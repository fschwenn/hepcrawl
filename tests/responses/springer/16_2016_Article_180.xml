              <Para ID="Par7">Together with Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979 for his formulation of the electroweak theory, which unified the quantum field theoretic description of the weak and electromagnetic interactions. He opened his Nobel Prize lecture by stating:<BlockQuote>

Speaking as an outstanding physicist being recognized for his outstanding contribution to physics, he indicated that he was part of a tightly knit community, that it is “<Emphasis Type="Italic">our</Emphasis> job in physics,” “<Emphasis Type="Italic">our</Emphasis> efforts,” and that it is the <Emphasis Type="Italic">collective</Emphasis> set of beliefs that are imperceptibly changed by the steady evolution of theoretical ideas.<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par10">The foci of this broadly painted historical overview of “the steady evolution of theoretical ideas” from Shelter Island I in 1947 to Shelter Island II in 1983—conferences organized to consider the fundamental problems of physics—are certain aspects of the developments in “fundamental” physics that were made by the high energy physics community after the establishment of the standard model. A related aspect, though here only dealt with impressionistically, is the changing character and role of the collective by virtue of the increase in the size of the community, the competence of the practitioners, and their specialization.<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef> During the period under consideration, the tempo of production of new knowledge changed dramatically and the level of the competence of the practitioners increased greatly. Hence, the role of the collective changed, as did the nature of the individuals who contributed importantly and <Emphasis Type="Italic">generatively</Emphasis> to the advances in knowledge.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par11">The standard model is the quantum field theoretical description of the interactions between quarks, gluons, leptons, and Higgs bosons. It combines electroweak theory—the quantum field theoretic description of the weak and electromagnetic interactions—with quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—the field theoretic description of the strong interactions. Both electroweak theory and QCD are gauge theories, a special class of quantum field theories in which an invariance principle uniquely specifies the form of the interactions which are necessarily mediated by gauge bosons. Understanding gauge theories led Chen-Ning Yang (who, with Robert Mills, was responsible for introducing non-abelian gauge theories into physics) to formulate the principle that “symmetry dictates interactions” which he considered as “one part of Einstein’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">geometrization of physics.</Emphasis>”<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef> QCD explains how unobservable quarks can combine and give rise to observable mesons and nucleons (the hadrons),<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef> which in turn can combine to give rise to stable nuclei, which when binding with electrons give rise to the observed atoms and molecules whose structure and properties are described by quantum electrodynamics (QED).<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>

Strong coupling effects at large distance scales prevent the colored quarks and gluons from propagating as free particles. The weak interactions are also short range because the associated gauge bosons acquire masses by the introduction of a Higgs scalar field that spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry of the vacuum of the theory. The existence of the scalar Higgs boson was established in 2012. Indeed, the Higgs boson is the only scalar “elementary” particle known to date and introduces a new “force” between the quarks and the bosons responsible for the electroweak and strong forces.<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>

The range of its applicability—from the sub-nuclear to the cosmological, some twenty orders of magnitude—is staggering. But the standard model’s twenty or so parameters (which specify the masses of the quarks, of various bosons, of coupling constants, all related to the Higgs boson and the mechanisms for generating masses of the leptons, quarks and the weak bosons),<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef> the fact that it treats the electroweak and strong forces separately, and its inability to incorporate general relativity indicate its limitations.<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef> New concepts of objects, interactions, space and time, and geometry, for example, will have to be considered and introduced.<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef> It is widely believed that relativistic quantum field theory—the <Emphasis Type="Italic">foundational</Emphasis> mathematical language used so far in the quantum description of nature, which attributes a pointlike character to the quarks, gluons, leptons and to their interactions with one another and with the Higgs bosons—is an “adequate” mathematical language in the domain in which the standard model is applicable but may have reached the limits of its validity.<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef> String theory, which is a generalization of quantum field theories in which the “foundational” elementary entities are not described as pointlike objects but as different modes of excitation of a string-like extended entity, has the valuable features that, on the one hand, it incorporates gravitation in an essential manner and, on the other, that by virtue of dealing with extended objects it does not encounter the divergences of relativistic quantum field theory.

Many more individuals who made important and generative contributions could be added to that list, especially individuals who entered the field in the late 1960s. Whom to include under what heading is also somewhat arbitrary. The boundaries between theoretical high energy physics, condensed matter physics, mathematical physics, computational physics, mathematics, etc., were and are porous and the frequency of their being crossed is indicative of the unusual abilities of the practitioners. Their competence reflects the demands and standards in the field. These standards are implemented by the demands that outstanding textbooks be mastered during the education of theorists. The importance attached to textbooks is indicated by the status of those who write the graduate level textbooks.<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef> The competence also reflect the importance of the summer schools in theoretical physics in the education of theorists—les Houches, Brandeis, Boulder, Cargèse, Erice, Varenna, and others<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>—and the value of the quick availability of the lectures given at them by the leading experts and innovators responsible for the advances, lectures that presented critical reviews of recent developments.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par25">Some of the theorists listed in endnote 18 were rewarded by Nobel Prizes—but it should be remembered that there is always an element of contingency, of politics, and of implementation of power in its selections.<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef> The high energy community was and is populated by remarkable individuals, many of them “off-scale.” For a host of reasons, some scientists whose cultural impact has been extraordinary—for example, Newton, Einstein, and Maxwell—became seen as exceptional and matchless and were mythologized. I believe that some of the mentioned theorists in endnote 18 were—are—as “off-scale” as Einstein, Maxwell, or Newton as far as their intellectual production is concerned. This is not to make Einstein, Maxwell, or Newton less “off-scale.” Indeed, theirs are some of the greatest achievements of the human mind. Nor do I wish to deny the extraordinary influence and impact an individual can make. But note that that there were only a handful of natural philosophers in Newton’s time; that physics became a separate discipline only in Maxwell’s time,<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef> with as yet no specialization between experimental and theoretical physics; and that there were only a few dozens outstanding theoretical and mathematical physicists during the first two decades of the twentieth century when Einstein made his exceptional contributions.<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef> This contrasts with the several hundred outstanding theorists addressing problems in high energy physics in the period between Shelter Island I and Shelter Island II. Even more important was the plethora of new accelerators of ever-higher energies coming into operation after Shelter Island I, the ever growing, ever more precise and robust sets of data being generated by them that became critical for formulating new models and theories. The thus generated numbers became evidence for a particular model or theory, or the basis for refuting a particular model or theory. These numbers had implications more extensive and wide ranging than those Einstein dealt with to corroborate his general theory of relativity. In addition, the tempo of the generation and of the evolution of theoretical ideas dramatically accelerated with the steady increase of the size of the high energy community. Similarly, the tempo at which the <Emphasis Type="Italic">collective</Emphasis> set of beliefs changed accelerated by virtue of the steady production of robust, precise, new data and the growth of the size of the community.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par26">Every theorist who contributed to the establishment of the standard model drew on the extensive, cumulative, collective knowledge of the community. The new knowledge they produced was critically analyzed by the community, and the acceptance by the community of their findings reflected a collective consensus and asserted the validity of their efforts.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par27">To emphasize the role of the social dimension of the collective and point to the bias cultural factors have introduced, I will here only note the importance of what Robert Merton has called the Matthew effect,<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef> namely, that the rich in fame and status get richer and the poor poorer. It is not merely that an eminent scientist will often receive more credit than a not-as-well recognized colleague for similar work they both did independently or that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous. The eminent scientist will usually be at a “richer” and “higher status” institution, hence have more outstanding colleagues, have more outstanding postdoctoral students working with him or her, be exposed to more seminars and colloquia devoted to recent advances, and therefore have more interactions with active researchers working at the frontiers of the field than workers at “poorer” or somewhat lower-status institutions.<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef> They thus have the possibility (and the ability) to work out quickly and successfully latent generative ideas they may have heard of. The net effect of all this is that his or her status is not just maintained by being at such an institution but that the potentiality of it being enhanced is always there.<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef> The converse is also true: those not in such positions, or at such institutions are somewhat disadvantaged. The introduction of arXiving one’s papers has greatly democratized the process, but often when a paper is made accessible on arXiv, its senior author is already extending the work.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par28">There are additional elements at work in the Matthew effect, factors whose importance has increased by virtue of the increasing size of the scientific communities and the accelerating tempo at which scientific knowledge is produced. The “rich” can now get richer and reap preferential credit by virtue of being invited as speakers or commentators to the ever more numerous workshops and conferences being held. But they also get “richer” by virtue of the power they hold and are able to exert, power that affects an ever-greater number of people. This by virtue of having an important voice on the committees that allocate research grants, by virtue of being able to place their students in positions at leading universities, by virtue of having influential editorial voices at periodicals having high impact factors—all this, in addition to the respect and esteem they command by virtue of their scholarly achievements.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par29">High energy physics, mathematical physics, condensed matter physics, and other subfields must be seen as constituting special kinds of communities of practice,<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef> operating in specific contexts, so that in order to understand their evolution attention must also be paid to the social interaction dimension within these communities and their institutions. To substantiate the role of the collective and to exhibit the dynamics involved in the creation and acceptance of new knowledge would require a fine-grained analysis of the social structure of the closely knit high energy theoretical physics community and of its cooperative and collaborative interactions that take place in a fiercely competitive environment.<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef> It would have to consider the administrative and intellectual leadership of the various communities of practice into which high energy theoretical physics has split and how high energy theorists are molded by the various hoops they are made to jump through: as undergraduates to obtain their bachelor degrees; as graduate students taking the required courses; as members of their thesis supervisors “families” of pre-docs and postdocs; as postdocs to demonstrate their originality and productivity.<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef> And it would necessitate an extensive analysis of the wider context in which the community evolved and therefore a consideration of the restructuring of universities and physics departments after World War II; an analysis of the role played by preprints; by the summer schools in theoretical physics and the lectures given there by outstanding contributors, lectures that introduced and assessed the most recent developments to large numbers of graduate students and postdocs in a setting that made for strong, informal interactions between lecturers and students; an analysis of the role played by the ever greater number of conferences—and of course, the political and economic factors that made all this possible: World War II, nuclear weaponry, the Cold War, the Picketty bubble between 1945 and 1970,<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef> the structure of the political institutions during that period, etc.<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef> It thus would require a much more extensive presentation than is possible in this exposition, and much more reflection before attempting to do so.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par30">Within the compass of this paper, I will only give a very broad overview of the context in which the collective sets of beliefs developed between Shelter Island I and Shelter Island II, and this with a minimum of technical details.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par31">There are several critical observations to be made regarding high energy experimental physics at the two endpoints. Progress in physics has always been determined by the strong coupling and interactions between theory, experiment, and instrumentation. More precisely, advances stem from the interaction among theory/theorists, experimenters and the data generated by them by observations and experiments, and the instruments used therein. The latter in turn are strongly coupled to technological developments.<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef> Of course, advances also reflect the context in which they were produced. In experimental high energy physics, the period from 1947 until the late 1970s was marked by the construction of ever more energetic accelerators and colliders, culminating in the late 1970s with DESY’s Petra, Fermilab’s Tevatron, and CERN’s Super Proton Synchrotron, accelerators achieving energies in the several hundred GeV range. When Shelter Island II took place, experiments on these machines had established the central components of the standard model.<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef> No new “startling” data were expected from the existing accelerators, only more precise data yielding further verifications of the standard model, and with the increasing precision perhaps the production of some data indicating possible discrepancies. That no new data at much higher energies would be forthcoming for probably a decade is one of the contextual factors that helps us understand the state of high energy physics in the early 1980s and helps us interpret the presentations at Shelter Island II.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par32">Partly due to the corroboration of the standard model (except for the Higgs sector); partly due to the fact that no new accelerator or collider was operating; partly due to the general curtailment of government funding after the Vietnam war; partly due to neoliberalism becoming a dominant voice in shaping governmental and corporate policies; partly because of important advances in molecular biology—and their translation into pharmaceuticals—that made biology the premier scientific field and attracted outstanding students; because of all these occurrences high energy physics in the United States was undergoing a transition in the early 1980s.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par33">Drastic changes had occurred in the way experimental high energy physics was being done. Christine Sutton<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef> gave a readily accessible, insightful, contemporaneous account of the transformation in her description of the enormous Underground Area (UA) detectors at CERN, their associated technologies, the huge manpower connected with their operation, and the interpretation of the enormous amount of data generated by them.<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef> The conventional wisdom at the time was that high energy physics was headed for an era of even larger collaborative experimental groups working at an ever smaller number of accelerators and interaction regions. This inference was being referred to colloquially as “fewer spigots and bigger detectors.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef> Complementing this assessment were worrisome trends in the availability, training, and size of the manpower pool: the number of graduate students in experimental high energy physics had drastically decreased during the 1960s, only bottoming out in 1973. In the early 1980s, only about 125 PhDs in experimental high energy physics were being awarded in the US annually, as compared to 250 at the peak. Furthermore, the numbers were dropping again and the average length of time to obtain a PhD had increased to six years.<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef> Adding to the manpower problem, during the 1970s, about half of the experimental physicists who had obtained (temporary) postdoctoral positions after obtaining their PhDs left the field after two years.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par34">This worrisome state of affairs was underscored in the proceedings of the 1982 Snowmass “Summer Study of Elementary Particle Physics and Future Facilities” that the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society organized.<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef> The purpose of the three weeks meeting was “to assess the future of elementary particle physics, to explore the limits of our technological facilities, and to consider the nature of future major facilities for particle physics in the United States.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef> Snowmass 1982 represented a restructuring of the practice of particle physics in the United States and was the result of a dedicated effort to have the national community involved the planning of the American high energy program. Past studies had typically been organized by one of the large laboratories (such as Fermi, SLAC, Brookhaven, or Cornell) to consider issues and problems specific to that particular laboratory. In contrast, Snowmass 1982 brought together high energy physicists from the entire US “to consider the future of the field from the point of view of the best national program.” Attendance at the meeting was open to everyone active in particle physics in the US. Some 150 persons participated in the study, two-thirds holding positions at universities, and one-third working at the national laboratories. Also in attendance were representatives from European high energy laboratories, and the problems addressed were not limited to those in the US.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par35">That experimental tools in high energy physics had become monstrously big and experiments were becoming extraordinarily slow was reflected in the composition of the theorists attending Shelter Island II. The transformation had split the high energy theory community. One component was composed of the theorists whose work was closely tied to experiments and the analysis of data generated by accelerators, theorists who were concerned with what experiments might be devised on the next generation of accelerators; another comprised the theorists involved in the design of the next generation of accelerators, storage rings, and colliders. Still another component was made up of the theorists who had become committed to one or another aspect of supersymmetry or of the early developments of string theory. Another component consisted of theorists who were leaving high energy physics because they were beginning to work in other disciplines. For Freeman Dyson (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>) particle physics had become “boring” because each experiment took a decade or longer to do. For him, the exciting frontier of physics had moved from particles to astronomy. After 1983, Dyson “stopped talking” to particle physicists and talked instead to astronomers and biologists.<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef> In fact, as Shelter Island II indicates, quite a number of young particle physicists had become cosmologists. Others, like Larry Abbott, an outstanding young particle physicist who had become a cosmologist in the late 1970s, turned his attention to the neurosciences in the mid-1980s.<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par36">Snowmass 1982 revealed some of the deep structural changes in the practice of experimental high energy physics. Similar deep changes occurred in theoretical physics during the 1970s with consequential changes in the practice of theoretical physics. Shelter Island II made these changes evident and explicit.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig1">

              <Para ID="Par37">In high energy physics, the establishment of the standard model as <Emphasis Type="Italic">the</Emphasis> foundational quantum theory gave quantum field theories based on the gauge principle a special status as the mathematical language in which to formulate theories and recognized gauge theories as manifesting a deep phenomenological symmetry of nature. But concurrently it became recognized that the regularization and renormalization procedures that were applied in order to extract observable consequences from all relativistic quantum field theories needed to be reinterpreted. This resulted in reconceptualizing all of the foundational field theories—Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) electroweak theory, QCD, general relativity—as “effective field theories” of limited range, not considered as “fundamental” theories.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par38">I emphasize this difference between “foundational” and “fundamental.” The quantum theory formulated in terms of quantum field theories had hierarchized the physical world. The atomic, nuclear, and subnuclear domains each have a set of “elementary” entities that populate that domain and each has a “foundational” theory, an effective field theory, which governs the dynamics of these entities.<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par39">The notion of a foundational theory is further elucidated by recalling Ian Hacking’s characterization of laboratory sciences as engaged in the creation of phenomena, and more precisely, in the purification and maintenance of phenomena “that do not exist in a pure state anywhere in the universe.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef> Foundational theories refer to these phenomena, phenomena that can be “maintained in the laboratory, brought back when interesting, or transformed into off-the-shelf transportable technology.” Furthermore, Hacking indicated that “this notion of purifying, creating and regularizing phenomena (and hence the world that we inhabit) certainly involves thinking and theorizing about the material world, but it also involves interaction with the world, and, in an unmetaphorical sense of the words, remaking it.” Hacking went on to state:<BlockQuote>
                  <Para ID="Par40">The world with which we interact does not fix just what discoveries or inventions shall be made, nor does our past knowledge determine what we shall count as a discovery. It is not preordained which instruments we shall devise, nor which phenomena we shall be able to stabilize or purify. A science can develop among many possible paths, bringing into being different phenomena. Phenomena that we create on one possible historical path might not be created on another historical path, say because we have invented neither the instruments nor the theory of the instruments through which we could recognize or control them. Moreover any path that we do follow has its own momentum. Experimental techniques and instruments, when they produce what are taken to be stable results, themselves suggest further steps to take by analogy. Had we not started out on a path, we would not have created later on what we do in fact create.<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par42">In his talk in July 2009 at the Sixth International Workshop on Chiral Dynamics, Steven Weinberg reviewed the development of effective field theories (EFT) of strong interactions. In his opening remarks he noted that “it all started with current algebra” and indicated that until the mid-1970s effective field theories were considered only as a tool to derive results from current algebra more easily.<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef> They were not considered dynamical theories, because they contained derivative couplings that made them useful in the lowest order of perturbation theory, but which in turn made them nonrenormalizable. Weinberg’s assessment of EFTs changed in 1976 when he gave a series of lectures on the theory of phase transitions at the Erice summer school and had studied Kenneth Wilson’s approach to integrating out short-distance degrees of freedom by introducing a variable ultraviolet cutoff.<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef> In Wilson’s approach, the bare couplings are given a cutoff dependence that guarantees that physical quantities are cutoff independent. But with the introduction of the cutoff it becomes necessary to introduce every possible interaction in the effective field theory in order to mimic the integrated-out contributions locally and to keep the physics cutoff independent, this even if the underlying theory is renormalizable.<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef> With the cutoff, non-renormalizable theories are just as renormalizable as renormalizable theories. Effective field theories derived by integrating out heavy particles were investigated by Thomas Appelquist and James Carrazone.<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par43">An illustration of this approach is the following. The foundational theory of weak interactions is the renormalizable GSW electroweak theory in which the weak interactions are mediated by the exchange of vector bosons that acquire their mass from a symmetry-breaking mechanism involving scalar Higgs bosons. When all the fermion energies are much lower than the intermediate boson masses, the low energy Fermi quark theory of weak interactions describes the weak interactions by an effective action with a current-current interaction term, where the current gets a contribution from both the quarks and the leptons.<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par49">It has been argued that the validity of the effective field theory approach depends on the unproven assumption of the existence of a “final theory.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef> But a less all-encompassing basis for the approach is appealing to the historical developments. One can consider the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation as derived from a non-relativistic quantum field theory, in which the mass and charge of the electron and those of the nuclei are empirically determined parameters. Subsequent developments—QED, electroweak theory, QCD—reduced dramatically the number of parameters to some twenty or so and allowed a partial reconstruction of the physical world in very special environments, that is, gave an explanation of the existence of entities such as mesons, neutrons, and protons. This reduction in the number of parameters and the experimental corroboration of the standard model then supplies the validation for the EFT approach: it is hugely <Emphasis Type="Italic">generative</Emphasis>. The parameters in the standard model reflect our ignorance of the physics at distances smaller than that specified by the largest mass at which the EFT is a valid representation of the dynamics.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par51">Another striking development of the mid-1970s was, in cosmology, the establishment of <Emphasis Type="Italic">its</Emphasis> “standard model”: the Robertson-Walker model that describes—when averaged over large distances—the present-day homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter and energy in the universe.<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef> The discovery in 1965 of the 3 K background microwave cosmic radiation (BCR) by A. A. Penzias and R. W. Wilson resulted in the general acceptance in the West of a hot big bang as the beginning of the universe.<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef> In its idealized version, the hot big bang theory asserts that the universe was born at some definite moment about some 13.8 billion years ago in a state of infinitely high temperature and infinitely large density. By the mid-1970s, there was a consensus in the West that there had been a big bang and that subsequently the universe had evolved from a state of extreme simplicity into a state of astounding complexity. The question became: “What are the dynamics that make it possible for the early universe to be so remarkably simple as indicated by the BCR and for it to be at present essentially homogeneous and isotropic (as far as matter and energy are concerned)?” Concomitantly, another question was: “How did the complex galactic structure that we observe today come to be?”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par52">The advances in particle physics that occurred in the 1970s provided some of the answers. The standard model greatly extended the range of energies—hence temperatures—and densities over which theoretical predictions could be made. It was this that allowed the exploration of the history of the universe at much earlier times.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par53">In fact, in the mid-1970s, high energy physics and cosmology became amalgamated.<CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef> The symbiosis and its evolution transformed the natural sciences. In the final version of his opening lecture at Shelter Island II, Murray Gell-Mann observed “particle physics and cosmology…[have] essentially merge[d] into one field, the field of fundamental physics which underlies all of natural science.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef> In high energy physics, the fundamental question addressed by the community became: “How did the standard model come to be?” In fact, the data for the possible empirical corroboration of a possible more “foundational” theory—whether a grand unified theory or one incorporating supersymmetry—began coming not only from SLAC, DESY, Fermilab, and CERN and their huge accelerators and detectors, or from Kamiokande and its huge water tank and thousands of photodetectors, but also, and ever more frequently, from astrophysical and cosmological data, such as the data obtained from the Hubble space telescope, the COBE satellite, and the LIGO gravitational wave detector.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par54">The acceptance of big bang cosmology transformed nuclear physics into nuclear science, a subdiscipline that encompasses all aspects of the genesis of matter since the time after the big bang when the standard model becomes a fairly accurate, precise, and robust description of the foundational entities that make up matter.<CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef> Similar issues are addressed in the planetary sciences,<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef> where investigations try to give answers to questions such as: “How did all the chemical compounds that arise in the formation of planets come to be?,”<CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef> “How did the moon come to be?,”<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef> “What makes a planet habitable to forms of life?,”<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef> “What makes the cosmos fit for life?”<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef> In that general sense, the natural sciences have become evolutionary sciences, animated by a Peirceian <Emphasis Type="Italic">Weltanschauung</Emphasis> that stipulates: “Don’t tell me what the law is.

                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par55">The merging of elementary particle physics and cosmology was also responsible for taking seriously inflationary models of the universe after the hot big bang. Shelter Island II highlights this development by the prominence given to the lectures of Alan Guth and Andrei Linde. All the various inflationary models assume the existence of a stage in the evolution of the very early universe after the big bang during which it expands exponentially. This exponential expansion is referred to as inflation.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par56">The idea of inflation arose from the applications of new insights in particle physics, in particular from grand unified theories (GUT), to cosmology. Inflation constitutes an attempt to give an answer to why the early universe could be remarkably simple yet evolve to its present state of being, on the very large scale, essentially homogeneous and isotropic. Inflation also gives plausible answers to other foundational cosmological questions.<CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par57">Inflation revolutionized cosmology because it eliminated the dependence of modeling on initial conditions. In hot big bang cosmology there is a time, essentially set by the Planck scale,<CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef> before which one cannot say anything because the dynamics that hold prior to that time is unknown. Pre–big bang cosmologies depended critically on the state of the universe at the Planck time. Very unnatural initial conditions had to be imposed for the universe to end up isotropic and homogeneous. Furthermore, all galactic structure had to be included as part of the initial data in the form of small perturbations.<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef> These did not did not arise spontaneously as a result of quantum fluctuations, as in inflationary models.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par58">The possible existence of an inflationary mechanism had been considered by Gliner, Linde, and Starobinski in the 1970s.<CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef> It was Alan Guth who formulated an inflationary model that made inflation plausible. His model simultaneously solved, first, the problem of monopoles—the extremely heavy particles carrying magnetic charge that would, according to many GUTs, be created in the very hot, very early universe and would be abundant at present<CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>; second, the flatness problem, namely that one would expect the universe to display a large curvature reflecting the fact that the only natural length parameter in a quantum gravity theory is the Planck scale, whereas the geometry of the universe seems to be Euclidean on the scale of the radius of the observable universe; and third, the horizon problem, which can be stated as the following question: “Why did all the causally disconnected regions of our present day universe start their expansion simultaneously?”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par59">But Guth’s model suffered from the fact that after inflation the universe would be too inhomogeneous. In 1982, Linde, and independently Albrecht and Steinhardt,<CitationRef CitationID="CR74">74</CitationRef> suggested a new inflationary model. But also their model had severe deficiencies. In 1983, at Shelter Island II, Linde proposed his chaotic inflationary model, which alleviated these problems. By the time of Shelter Island II, it had become clear that an inflationary cosmology could arise from a wide range of initial conditions and that a central problem was to explain the fluctuations observed in the spectrum of the cosmic black body radiation as these were closely connected with galaxy formation.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par60">Another major confluence of developments took place in the 1970s, which resulted in a new, cooperative, amazingly generative, <Emphasis Type="Italic">symbiotic</Emphasis> relationship between physics and mathematics. Thus Dyson in his 1983 review of Manin’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">Mathematics and Physics</Emphasis> could state: “In Manin’s view, the present epoch is characterized by a growing willingness of physicists and mathematicians to learn from each other and to transfer tools and techniques from one branch to another. The increasing overlap between physics and mathematics provides opportunities for the continued enrichment of both disciplines.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef> There were many reasons for how this came about. The early research on quantum field theories was concerned with aspects that could be addressed using perturbation theory, such as proofs of the renormalizability of such theories. However, it turns out that it is possible for quantum field theories to violate a symmetry that is present at the classical level, i.e., in the limit when <Emphasis Type="Italic">h</Emphasis>→0.<CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef> When this occurs, one speaks of the theory having an anomaly. Mathematically, <Emphasis Type="Italic">violating</Emphasis> a symmetry means that it is impossible to construct a unitary representation of the symmetry transformations of the classical system underlying the quantum description on the Hilbert space of state vectors of the quantum theory. If it is impossible to construct such a representation that commutes with the Hamiltonian of the quantum theory, one then characterizes the situation as a violation of a dynamical symmetry.<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef> It turns out that understanding anomalies can be viewed as a problem in algebraic topology.<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef> Furthermore, non-abelian gauge theories, such as the <Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(3)-based Yang-Mills field theories are highly non-linear and have non-perturbative solutions that already at the classical level, have deep, unsuspected properties—e.g. instantons, solutions of the classical Euclideanized Yang-Mills equations of motion that are localized in all directions of space-time, solutions that <Emphasis Type="Italic">depend on the dimension of the space-time</Emphasis>.<CitationRef CitationID="CR79">79</CitationRef> Understanding these aspects of non-abelian gauge theories likewise required understanding the <Emphasis Type="Italic">topological</Emphasis> properties of gauge field theories and their dependence on spatial dimension.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par61">The early research on <Emphasis Type="Italic">non-abelian</Emphasis> gauge quantum field theories was concerned with proofs of the renormalizability of such theories when the symmetry of theory was spontaneously broken; with investigations of their short distance behavior; with calculations that validated asymptotic freedom and certain others features of the theory. All these problems could be addressed, and dependable results obtained, by using perturbation theory. Even so, the problem of quark confinement required a non-perturbative approach to gauge theories and led to the introduction of tools from differential geometry and algebraic topology.<CitationRef CitationID="CR80">80</CitationRef> As ’t Hooft observed: “Without understanding the physics, mathematics does not answer your questions. Without understanding the mathematics, your physics theories will not work successfully either.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR81">81</CitationRef> The importance of mastering these mathematical aspects of gauge quantum field theories is indicated by the fact that the 1979 Cargèse Summer School was devoted to these recent developments in gauge theories and that three leading mathematicians who had been responsible for important mathematical advances of great relevance for the deeper understanding of non-abelian gauge theories—Michael Atiyah, Raoul Bott, and Isadore Singer—were invited to give lectures at the school.<CitationRef CitationID="CR82">82</CitationRef> The organizers of the summer school in the preface to the published lectures commented: “The presence of mathematicians as enthusiastic participants and masterful lecturers in this school deserves special mention. We hope this trend will continue.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR83">83</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par62">What was new about this new interaction between physics and mathematics was that physicists were attacking problems in “pure” mathematics and, conversely, mathematicians were attacking problems in “pure” physics, in quantum field theory and string theory. Traditionally, physics had provided mathematical problems and mathematicians provided or had provided the solutions to these problems (such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, Tullio Levi-Civita, David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, Hermann Weyl, and John von Neumann).<CitationRef CitationID="CR84">84</CitationRef> The relationship at times resulted in the development of new mathematics (Fourier series, Weiner-Feynman-Kac integrals, Murray–von Neumann operator algebras, etc.). What was dramatically new since the mid-1970s was that physicists were formulating stunning conjectures that subsequently mathematicians were able to frame and express as rigorous mathematical statements, and in the process a great deal of new mathematics was being created. The symbiosis has proven to be amazingly generative for both physics and mathematics.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par63">An example of this new symbiotic relation between physics and mathematics is the following: In 1982, making use of the nonlinear space of instanton parameters as a new geometrical tool, Simon Donaldson (as a second year graduate student!), proved a result that, according to the eminent mathematician Michael Atiyah, “stunned the mathematical world.” Donaldson’s findings implied that there exist “exotic” four-dimensional manifolds that are topologically but not differentially equivalent to the standard Euclidean four-space. In the hands of Edward Witten, Joseph Polchinski, Nathan Seiberg, and others, supersymmetric field theories and string theories turned out to be amazingly powerful and generative tools for the development of new results in algebraic and differential topology and other mathematical fields.<CitationRef CitationID="CR85">85</CitationRef> Witten was awarded the Fields Medal 1990 for his contributions to mathematics.<CitationRef CitationID="CR86">86</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par64">It is interesting to note that these advances, both in physics and in mathematics, stemmed from attempts either to <Emphasis Type="Italic">unify</Emphasis>, or from a recognition of a <Emphasis Type="Italic">unity</Emphasis> in what appeared to be disparate components (and subdisciplines) of either physics or mathematics. In both mathematics and in physics, a belief in unification has played an essential role.<CitationRef CitationID="CR87">87</CitationRef> It is easier to specify the nature of the unification sought in physics, where the attempt to encompass the strong, the electroweak and gravitational forces in a single theoretical framework is the driving motivation and where “nature” provides standards for adequacy.<CitationRef CitationID="CR88">88</CitationRef> I am not competent even to adumbrate what would constitute a “unification” of mathematics. Corry has insightfully indicated what this meant from Hilbert to Bourbaki.<CitationRef CitationID="CR89">89</CitationRef> Later, topologists such as Alexander Grothendieck, Robert Langlands, Raoul Bott, Michael Atiyah, Vladimir Arnold, and Yuri Manin, were indeed motivated by a desire of “unifying” mathematics, and Wiles with his proof of Fermat’s conjecture presents an outstanding specific example.<CitationRef CitationID="CR90">90</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par65">The belief that firm mathematical foundations stabilize physical theories and that underlying quantum field theories and string theory is a self-consistent mathematical framework yet to be created, is what motivates the physicists. Conversely, a number of mathematical geometric objects, structures, and notions can be formulated in terms of quantum field theories and strings, and the physicists’ non-rigorous techniques provide (and provided) deep novel insights, insights that are not or were not evident from an internal mathematical perspective. In fact, the mathematicians and physicists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton devoted the academic year 1996–97 to teach a small group of mathematicians the basic physical concepts of quantum field theory and string theory. The goal was “to create and convey an understanding of some fundamental notions of physics, such as quantum field theory, supersymmetry and string theory…[with an] emphasis on developing the intuition stemming from functional integrals.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR91">91</CitationRef> There is no better indication of the new symbiosis than Pierre Deligne et al.’s <Emphasis Type="Italic">Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians,</Emphasis> the two volumes containing the lectures given during that year.<CitationRef CitationID="CR92">92</CitationRef>

The early 1980s measurements by Hans Dehmelt and others of the magnetic moment of the electron and of the muon required the evaluation of eighth-order Feynman diagrams. The same kind of calculational precision was demanded of some of the QCD calculations to interpret the data generated by the then operating accelerators and detectors.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par70">In concluding this introduction, I want to stress that although I am focusing on the two Shelter Island conferences and attaching great importance to both of them, Shelter Island II was neither a watershed nor a turning point in theoretical ideas in the way Shelter Island I was. Rather, Shelter Island II highlighted some of the deep changes that were occurring. It indicated that a new era in “fundamental” physics had begun with the recognition on the one hand, of the richness of non-abelian gauge theories, and on the other, of the limitations of the standard model and of all local quantum field theories, so that both big bang cosmology and string theory, though highly speculative, were novel features to be taken seriously.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par71">Shelter Island II also indicated the transformation of high energy theoretical physics at the sociological level: a new, younger generation of theorists was taking over the intellectual leadership of the community, a generation that had experienced the upheavals of the 1960s and the 1970s: the civil rights movements, and in particular, the university students’ protests. These protests had raised fundamental questions about authority. The students raised questions about their civil and political rights, about the authoritarian character of universities, about the civil and political rights of blacks, about the reasons and aims of the war in Vietnam, and about the authoritarian character of social institutions more generally.<CitationRef CitationID="CR102">102</CitationRef> And the protests were global. The witnessing of, or participating in the students’ protests by the members of the generation taking over the intellectual leadership of high energy physics is reflected in their stance regarding authority: they were ready to question everything.<CitationRef CitationID="CR103">103</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par72">For the young theorists, there was another corollary connected with having witnessed or having taken part in the student rebellion: the desire to have their theoretical physics “pure” and not of or in service to the military-industrial complex. This resonated with the component of the mathematical community that likewise wanted their mathematics to be pure—and not “applied” in any way.<CitationRef CitationID="CR104">104</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par73">It is interesting to compare Shelter Island II with another conference, the Royal Society Discussion Meeting held on May 25–26, 1983, a few days before Shelter Island II. “The Constants of Physics” were the focus of the Discussion Meeting, a conference that had been organized by William McCrea, Martin Rees, and Steven Weinberg. In his introductory remarks McCrea stated: “What distinguishes modern physics from classical physics is the recognition of the role of fundamental (or universal) constants. Mathematical [read theoretical] physics must be formulated so as to admit such constants; that is what distinguishes it from other applied mathematics. It is the particular values actually possessed by the constants that make our universe what it is. Some analysis of this whole situation is the theme of this Discussion…. The domain is one in which observation and theory are inseparable.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR105">105</CitationRef> After pointing to the important role that contingency and context play in the formulation of physical theories McCrea noted:<BlockQuote>
                  <Para ID="Par74">At any point in our deliberations, it therefore seems inevitable that we should speak in terms of some definite <Emphasis Type="Italic">theoretical model</Emphasis> of the world of experience.

We construct a model, we do not discover it.</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par75">Is it nevertheless true to say that models lead to the discovery of constants of physics?

Irvine on the limits on the variability of coupling constant from the Oklo natural reactor; and by B. E. J. Pagel on the implications of quasar spectroscopy for the constancy of constants. There were then talks on the most “foundational” theoretical models: by S. Weinberg on the theoretical prospects for understanding the values of fundamental constants; by C. H. Llewllyn Smith on the standard model; by S. Adler on Einstein’s theory of general relativity considered as a long-wavelength effective field theory; by J. Ellis on the attempt to formulate models beyond the standard model, models that unify the strong, electroweak, and gravitational forces; and by H. B. Nielsen on field theories without “fundamental” gauge symmetries. The next set of talks were concerned with the early universe: T. W. B. Kibble on phase transitions in the early universe; S. W. Hawking on the cosmological constant; and M. J. Rees on large numbers and ratios in astrophysics and cosmology. The next two talks were of a more general character but anchored in and concerned with observable phenomena: by W. H. Press and A. P. Lightman on the dependence of macrophysical phenomena on the values of the fundamental constants; and by J. D. Barrow on the dependence of phenomena on the dimensionality of space-time. The final talk by D. Carter addressed a subject that had recently obtained a great deal of attention: the anthropic principle.</Para>

In subsequent sections, I give an overview of certain theoretical aspects because that was what Shelter Island II was concerned with. The title of its proceedings, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Shelter Island II</Emphasis>, edited by Jackiw, Khuri, Weinberg, and Witten, characterized Shelter Island II as a conference on quantum field theory and “the Fundamental Problems of Physics.” I narrate very briefly some of the theoretical advances that led to the standard model as illustrations of the “steady evolution of theoretical ideas, leading almost imperceptibly to changes in previous beliefs” and to make understandable to the non-expert some of the later developments.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par92">The Shelter Island I conference took place from June 2 to 4, 1947, at the Ram’s Head Inn on Shelter Island at the tip of Long Island. I have elsewhere narrated how Shelter Island I came to be.<CitationRef CitationID="CR119">119</CitationRef> Here I only want to make a few remarks concerning the sociology of Shelter Island I and also to report on the new light that has been shed on what happened at Shelter Island I by the recent discovery of the detailed notes that Hans Bethe took at the conference.<CitationRef CitationID="CR120">120</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par93">The dominant figures at Shelter Island I were the physicists responsible for the wartime developments of radar and of the atomic bomb: J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Bethe, John von Neumann, Isidor I. Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Robert Serber, Edward Teller, George Uhlenbeck, Victor Weisskopf, and John Archibald Wheeler. Also invited to the conference were some of the younger physicists they considered outstanding—Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, David Bohm, Robert Marshak, Arnold Nordsieck, Herman Feshbach, Willis Lamb, and Abraham Pais—who all, except for Pais, had worked at Los Alamos, or at the Columbia, MIT, or Berkeley Rad Labs during the war. Gregory Breit, Linus Pauling, John van Vleck, and Karl Darrow were invited because of their seniority. There were no women among the participants.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par94">Except for Hendrik Kramers, who was in the United States because he was the chair of the technical committee helping the United Nations formulate a plan for the international control of atomic energy, and Abraham Pais, who was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and had made some recent important contributions to elucidating the self-energy problem in quantum field theory, only American physicists were invited. In fact, Frank Jewett, the head of the National Academy of Science, the institution that sponsored the conference, Duncan McInness, who formulated the idea of the conference, and Karl Darrow, the secretary of the American Physical Society who had helped organize the conference, all wanted the conference to marshal the power of <Emphasis Type="Italic">American</Emphasis> physics to address and solve the most pressing problems in fundamental physics, just as it had solved urgent and deeply consequential wartime problems. All three wanted the conference to demonstrate that theoretical physics in the United States had come into its own with the “younger men” who had been born and trained there. The conference was to prove the strength of American theoretical physics not only in wartime activities, but also in “pure” physics.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par95">Shelter Island I and the two subsequent conferences it engendered (the Pocono and Oldstone conferences) were small, closed, and elitist in spirit. In a sense, they mark the postponed end of an era, that of the 1930s, and its characteristic style of doing physics: small groups and small budgets, as in the case of the Washington Conferences of Theoretical Physics. None cost more than $1500.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par96">What the newly found notes that Bethe took at Shelter Island I corroborate, and in fact amplify, is what Darrow had recorded in his notes on the conference: the overwhelming dominance of Oppenheimer in all matters, be they technical, intellectual, or administrative. The notes also gives valuable details of the presentations. On the first day of the conference, Lamb presented the most recent data of his experiment with Robert Retherford that measured the energy difference between the 2s<Subscript>1/2</Subscript> and 2p<Subscript>1/2</Subscript> levels in hydrogen. His robust data established that contrary to the solutions of the Dirac equation for the energy levels of an electron in a Coulomb field, the 2s and 2p levels of the hydrogen atom are not degenerate, but that the 2s level shifted [is] up by about 0.037cm<Superscript>−1</Superscript> (1100 Mc).” In the discussion that followed Lamb’s presentation, Oppenheimer pointed out that if one calculated the <Emphasis Type="Italic">difference</Emphasis> between the 2p and 2s energy levels using hole theory a finite answer might be obtained, given that the divergences encountered were logarithmically divergent (see figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>).<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

              <Para ID="Par99">During the afternoon of the second day, Weisskopf reviewed the divergence difficulties in the hole theory calculations of the self-energy of an electron. In a paper that he had written in 1939, he had indicated that in hole theory the divergence would be logarithmic to all orders of perturbation theory and (according to Breit’s notes of Shelter Island I) Weisskopf agreed with Oppenheimer’s hunch that a hole theoretic calculation of the difference in the 2p and 2s energy levels would not diverge. During the ensuing discussion, Weisskopf and Schwinger indicated how a hole-theoretic calculation of the level shift might be attempted and suggested further reasons why a finite result might result from the applications of Kramers’s ideas.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par100">On the third day of the conference, Oppenheimer, in an extensive presentation, indicated the problems raised by the Conversi, Pancini, and Piccioni experiment. That experiment indicated that the meson detected in cosmic ray showers near the surface of the earth could not be the meson postulated by Yukawa to be responsible for the nuclear forces between nucleons, whether the meson theories are treated perturbatively or non-perturbatively as in the Oppenheimer-Schwinger strong coupling approach of the late 1930s. The ensuing discussion gave rise to the Marshak and Bethe paper in which the Marshak two-meson hypothesis was formulated.<CitationRef CitationID="CR122">122</CitationRef> Marshak suggested that there were two kinds of mesons. The heavier ones were produced at the top of the atmosphere by cosmic rays in nuclear reactions. He identified these with the mesons Yukawa had postulated. The π-mesons then decay into the lighter µ mesons, which do not interact strongly with nuclei.<CitationRef CitationID="CR123">123</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par101">After the conference was over, Bethe performed his famous non-relativistic calculation on the train ride from New York to Schenectady. The paper in which he proved that the level shift would be accounted for by quantum electrodynamics was completed by June 9 and thereafter circulated to the participants of the Shelter Island conference. In his paper, Bethe acknowledged in a footnote the comments by Weisskopf and Schwinger that a hole-theoretic calculation of energy level differences would be finite.<CitationRef CitationID="CR124">124</CitationRef> Their insight justified the high-energy cutoff he introduced in his calculation.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par102">But in his paper Bethe <Emphasis Type="Italic">did not</Emphasis> acknowledge Kramers’s talk even though Kramers’s presentation had been very important by stressing the importance of expressing observables in terms of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">experimental</Emphasis> mass of the electron. That Kramers’s talk was influential not only by virtue of his “philosophical” standpoint but also by virtue of its technical components is reflected in the fact that his use of the Hertz potential and his derivation of the potential that the dressed electron with experimental mass experiences became the point of departure of Schwinger in his quantum electrodynamic calculation of the magnetic moment of the electron and of the Lamb shift. Moreover, at Shelter Island II, Weisskopf recalled that in 1939 both he and Kramers were lecturers at the Michigan Summer School. In one of their conversations, the recent paper by Pasternack,<CitationRef CitationID="CR125">125</CitationRef> in which he reviewed all the high precision spectroscopic work that had been done on the 2s level of hydrogen and had concluded that the 2s level lies higher than the 2p level, came up. Kramers had told him then: “You younger people should calculate the difference between the energy of the hydrogen 2s state and the free electron. Both are infinite, and you should take the difference, which is hopefully finite, and that may be the Pasternack effect.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR126">126</CitationRef> Kramers had been the reason for French and Weisskopf stating their hole theory calculation of the 2s-2p energy difference in 1946, before Shelter Island I and before they had knowledge of Lamb and Retherford’s results. It is interesting to note that at Shelter Island II, Bethe did interject during Lamb’s talk that Kramers had “inspired him.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par103">Bethe probably did not acknowledge Kramers’s presentation in his paper because Bethe thought that he had a much simpler way than Kramers to incorporate Kramers’s insight. Bethe had noted that the self-energy of a free non-relativistic electron calculated quantum electrodynamically could be considered an electromagnetic mass of the electron—and though divergent—was to be added to the mechanical mass of the electron. The only meaningful statements of the theory involve the sum of the electromagnetic and mechanical masses, which combination is to be identified as the experimental mass of a free electron. In contrast to Kramers’s approach, Bethe’s was a <Emphasis Type="Italic">model-independent</Emphasis> formulation of mass renormalization that did not assume an extended charge distribution to the electron. And in contrast to Schwinger and Weisskopf’s initial insight that a hole-theoretic calculation that computed the <Emphasis Type="Italic">difference</Emphasis> between the energies of two levels would be finite, Bethe’s mass renormalization allowed computing the energy of each level and gave an unambiguous formulation of mass renormalization in the non-relativistic case. Moreover, he knew what was required to formulate an analogous relativistic prescription. Weisskopf and Schwinger, though emphasizing Kramers’s insight, could not do so at Shelter Island.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par104">Dresden, in his biography of Kramers, claimed that Kramers did not receive adequate credit for his contributions at Shelter Island.<CitationRef CitationID="CR127">127</CitationRef> Bethe’s Shelter Island notes confirm that he was right.<CitationRef CitationID="CR128">128</CitationRef> Here is an example of the Matthew effect at work.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par105">To Bethe, the pragmatist for whom numbers were always the criterion of good physics and who at Los Alamos had just been deeply and successfully involved in the war effort calculating numbers that translated into physical effects and measurable empirical data, the challenge was to get the numbers out and account for the magnitude of the 2p-2s shift in hydrogen and for the new values of the hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and deuterium that Nafe, Nelson, and Rabi had measured. Accounting for the empirical data would become evidence for the correctness of the theory, or at least for the model that approximated it. Kramers’s approach was too model dependent, too theoretical and too far removed from calculating numbers. For Bethe, the value of a novel idea was gauged by whether it could help you calculate numbers that could be compared with empirical data.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par106">Bethe’s calculation was crucial. By introducing the concept of mass renormalization and its associated meaning in the simple manner he had, and indicating how it is to be used in the case of a bound electron, Bethe’s calculation gave a new perspective on how to address quantum electrodynamical calculations and obtain numbers that could be compared with experimental data. Furthermore, Bethe could convincingly justify the cutoffs he had to introduce in his non-relativistic calculation and obtain a logarithmic expression for the Lamb shift that agreed with the observed level shift. It should be added that only Bethe could have evaluated the logarithmic contribution as quickly as he did. He had encountered similar logarithmic expressions when calculating quantum mechanically the energy loss of fast charged particle traversing matter in his <Emphasis Type="Italic">Habilitationschrift</Emphasis> in 1929.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par107">Schwinger made another crucial calculation, perhaps a more influential one than Bethe’s, by calculating the quantum electrodynamic contribution to the magnetic moment of the Dirac electron. His calculation was crucial because it was the first <Emphasis Type="Italic">field theoretical</Emphasis> perturbative calculation of quantum electrodynamic radiative corrections that was Lorentz and gauge invariant. Up to this point all calculations had been based on hole theory.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par108">Hole theory was not gauge invariant because the vacuum subtraction prescription labeled states according to <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> and only <Emphasis Type="Italic">p − eA</Emphasis> and not <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> is gauge invariant.<CitationRef CitationID="CR129">129</CitationRef> The lack of gauge invariance led to arbitrariness and difficulties in all the prewar calculations. It already arose in the calculation of the electron self energy in lowest order of perturbation theory. The self-energy was divergent, but introducing a cutoff for the possible momenta <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> to obtain finite results destroyed the Lorentz invariance of the theory.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par109">Schwinger’s calculation indicated that a gauge and Lorentz invariant quantum <Emphasis Type="Italic">field theoretic</Emphasis> description of both electrons and radiation could be formulated, and that with it one could calculate observable consequences.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par110">Shelter Island I was a landmark whose impact was comparable to that of the Solvay Congress of 1911, which set the stage for all the subsequent developments in quantum theory by virtue of Planck’s and Einstein’s interpretations of the precise measurements of black body radiation as a function of temperature. Similarly, Shelter Island I provided the initial stimulus for the post–World War II developments in quantum field theory—renormalization theory, effective, relativistically invariant computational methods, Feynman diagrams—by virtue of Lamb and Retherford’s experiment on the fine structure of hydrogen and Nafe, Nelson, and Rabi’s experiment on the hyperfine structure of hydrogen. The conference was also responsible for the elucidation of the structure of the mesonic component of cosmic rays.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par111">The Shelter Island, Pocono, and Oldstone conferences were the precursors of the Rochester Conferences on High Energy Physics.<CitationRef CitationID="CR130">130</CitationRef> But they differed from these later conferences in important ways. The Rochester conferences were more professional, international, and democratic and had the imprint of the new era: the large group efforts and the large budgets involved in machine physics.<CitationRef CitationID="CR131">131</CitationRef> Also, whereas Shelter Island and Pocono looked upon QED as a self-contained discipline, the Rochester conferences saw “particle physics” come into its own, with QED as one of its subfields—albeit one with a privileged, paradigmatic position.</Para>

              <Heading>From Shelter Island I to Shelter Island II</Heading>
              <Para ID="Par112">After World War II, physicists in the United States became admired and lavishly rewarded for their wartime efforts. The identification of physics with material and military elements of national security—radar, computers, transistors, nuclear weaponry—had given them power. The United States did not suffer the physical destruction the war had wreaked on Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan. So after the war it prospered economically from the industrial goods it could readily manufacture and from the access to cheap Middle Eastern oil that it had obtained from Great Britain in return for its Lend-Lease help during the war. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, usually referred to as the GI Bill, granted returning veterans tuition and living expenses to continue their education and resulted in universities, and their physics and engineering departments in particular, to expand dramatically. Research contracts by the armed forces and by the AEC made it possible for physics departments to support large numbers of research assistants and postdoctoral fellows. Several generations of outstanding physicists were trained as a result of this expansion. The magnitude of the enterprise is reflected in the fact that an average of 500 PhDs in physics were awarded annually by American universities from 1950 to 1960. The number of physics PhDs granted in 1970 climbed to 1500. It declined considerably thereafter with the sharp curtailment of governmental funds to universities that reflected the upheaval brought about by the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, the student protest movements, and the Republican party gaining extended control of the presidency, of the Congress, and of the state legislatures. The 1970s marked the beginning of a deep change in the political and economic structure of the United States. Neoliberalism began assuming a dominant role in shaping economic policy, globalization deeply changed the structure of commerce and industry, fundamentalism began playing a more vociferous and influential role in shaping the political agenda as reflected in the limitations on teaching evolution in public schools, and a distrust of scientific expertise and of science more generally became apparent. The cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in 1993 is perhaps the clearest indication of the public’s disenchantment with high energy physics, and with “fundamental” science more generally.<CitationRef CitationID="CR132">132</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par113">Shelter Island II is part of that story. It owes its existence to Rockefeller University’s response to what was happening during the 1970s. The Rockefeller Institute was founded in 1901 and was to be, and until 1959 was, devoted entirely to medical and biomedical research. In 1959, it started graduate programs leading to the PhD in various disciplines in the natural sciences and in 1965 renamed itself Rockefeller University. A PhD program in physics was established in the early 1960s. In the late 1970s, in the wake of governmental cutbacks for research in the sciences and the changing national political and socio-economic context, Rockefeller University reconsidered its expansion and closed various PhD programs. Shelter Island II, which was held in June 1983, thirty-six years after Shelter Island I, was organized by Nicola Khuri, a highly respected theoretical physicist and a professor at Rockefeller University,<CitationRef CitationID="CR133">133</CitationRef> in part to substantiate the value and importance of the physics program to the university.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par114">The difference in economic, social, political, and cultural contexts is one of the sharp contrasts between Shelter Island I and II. Another is the size and cost of the two conferences. Some twenty-five scientists attended Shelter Island I and its total cost was less than $1,500, all paid for by the National Academy of Sciences. Over a hundred theoretical physicists were invited to Shelter Island II, and some sixty attended. Its budget was roughly $100,000, with many of the attendees paying their own expenses. The rest of the expenses were covered by contributions from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Texaco Philanthropic Foundation, and by Susan B. Borden. Rockefeller University did not contribute any funds. The ravages of inflation are illustrated by the fact that the expenditure to accommodate all the twenty-five participants of Shelter Island I for one night at the comfortable and elegant Ram’s Head Inn, where the conference took place, was $200. At Shelter Island I, the average per diem cost per person was $20; at Shelter Island II it was $80.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par115">Shelter Island II in many ways marked the end of a period of remarkable advances in what was then considered “fundamental” physics, a period that culminated with the experimental verification to a remarkable degree of precision of the standard model and the acceptance of gauge theories as the way to formulate interactions.

                <Heading>Rockefeller University</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par124">The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was established in 1901, during the period when philanthropies by the “robber barons” founded colleges, universities, museums, and other such public institutions.<CitationRef CitationID="CR136">136</CitationRef> At the urging of Rev. Frederick Gates, the Baptist minister who was to guide John D. Rockefeller Sr.’s philanthropy and who had noted that his “fortune is rolling up like an avalanche!” and that he “must distribute it faster than it grows! If … not, it will crush you and your children and your children’s children!,” Rockefeller endowed the University of Chicago in 1890, the Rockefeller Institute a decade later, and the Rockefeller Foundation in 1913. The Rockefeller Institute was to devote itself to biological and medical research as an independent institution not attached to any university nor to any hospital.<CitationRef CitationID="CR137">137</CitationRef> Under Simon Flexner’s directorship from 1903 to 1935, it attracted an outstanding research staff and became recognized as being one of the preeminent institutions in innovative and generative applications of biochemistry and the physical sciences to biology and to medicine. After World War II, under the leadership of Detlev Bronk, the Rockefeller Institute transformed from a research institute to a graduate university in the natural sciences. In 1954, its charter was changed to give it the right to confer the degrees of PhD and of Doctor of Medical Sciences. In 1964, it changed its name to Rockefeller University and became then (and has remained) the only institution in the United States calling itself a university that grants only doctorates. Its eminence as a university is indicated by the fact that in 1965 its senior faculty, which consisted of some forty full professors and ten emeriti, included three Nobel laureates, and that thirty-six of the faculty were members of the National Academy of Sciences.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par125">By 1965, a modern nine-story building costing $3.5 million had been built to accommodate the laboratories and offices of its 300 junior and senior faculty members and its 118 graduate students, and to house in some eighty rooms the stalls and cages for the 20,000 mice, 3000 guinea pigs and the dozens of opossums and minks used by the faculty and students for research. In addition, several other buildings had been erected: one to house a large auditorium, one for graduate student apartments, and another, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall, was to function as a social and residential center for visiting scientists.<CitationRef CitationID="CR138">138</CitationRef>
                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par126">The Rockefeller faculty was among the highest paid in the US and all the graduate students were holding full fellowships paying at least $3500 per annum. Furthermore, almost all of the expenditures connected with the research carried out by the faculty and by the graduate students were paid for by the university. At the time, the university could easily afford these expenditures. The value of its investments amounted to over $200 million and the return from them covered its operating budget of $8.1 million, which included the research expenditures. In fact, the return from the endowment had allowed $1.3 million to be put in reserve during 1965.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par127">The special character of the university that Detlev Bronk imparted to it can be gleaned from the structure of the commencement exercises he oversaw. He would make brief opening and closing remarks, and in place of a commencement address members of the faculty would review the accomplishments of the graduates. Thus, in 1961, when some ten students received their degree, among them two women, Bronk commented: “No public figure speaks at length of his concerns nor tells of his proposals for a better world as is often the case on these occasions. We will not boast of our accomplishments. The achievements to be mentioned are those of the our graduates.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR139">139</CitationRef> In transforming itself into a university, the disciplines in which PhD degrees were granted were expanded, but the administrative structure was not changed. No departments were formed. Professors were hired on an individual basis and given funds with which to run their laboratories, which were administered like fiefdoms. Junior faculty members were attached to a particular laboratory and its professor. In 1961, George Uhlenbeck accepted a professorship in physics, and his presence helped recruit Theodore Berlin (1961),<CitationRef CitationID="CR140">140</CitationRef> Ezekiel G. D. Cohen (1963), Abraham Pais (1964),<CitationRef CitationID="CR141">141</CitationRef> and Nicholas Khuri (1964). Mark Kac, an eminent mathematician, joined the university in 1962.<CitationRef CitationID="CR142">142</CitationRef> Similarly, Donald Davidson, Joel Feinberg, Harry G. Frankfurt, and Saul A. Kripke, all four outstanding philosophers, were hired.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par128">In 1968, Detlev Bronk retired as president of the university<CitationRef CitationID="CR143">143</CitationRef> and was succeeded by Frederick Seitz, who had been a member of the board of trustees for the previous four years. Bronk and Seitz had known each other for a long time. Throughout the postwar period they both were members of various high-level science advisory bodies to the government. Seitz had succeeded Bronk as president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS),<CitationRef CitationID="CR144">144</CitationRef> and throughout his presidency he was in close contact with Bronk in connection with NAS matters.<CitationRef CitationID="CR145">145</CitationRef> Under Seitz’s leadership, the NAS, which has the responsibility of giving technical advise to the federal government, shed its reluctance to be actively engaged in shaping policy relating to scientific and technological issues. Seitz was deeply involved in the formation of the nationwide consortium of universities that administered the 200 GeV accelerator that the Atomic Energy Commission had underwritten at what became the Fermi National Laboratory in Weston, Illinois. During Seitz’s presidency, the NAS initiated the creation of the National Academy of Engineering, as well as several other institutions and agencies to advise the government on technical issues.<CitationRef CitationID="CR146">146</CitationRef>
                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par129">Daniel Greenberg, in his article in <Emphasis Type="Italic">Science</Emphasis> reporting on the appointment of Seitz as president of Rockefeller University, noted that:<BlockQuote>
                    <Para ID="Par130">it was no secret that Seitz and some of the Academy’s elders have been feuding over Seitz’s close ties with the Pentagon and his belief that the Academy should have no reservations about making its resources available to the military… But there is no evidence that these differences ever reached disruptive proportions or that they played any part in Seitz’s decision to go to Rockefeller. Though the Academy is probably too unwieldy and tradition-encrusted to become an important instrument of political concern, many of its members have of late taken to affixing their names to political statements of one sort or another, especially petitions opposing the administration’s long-standing Vietnam policies. It is doubtful that political attitudes will figure large in the selection of a successor to Seitz, but it is also doubtful that the membership will be altogether docile on this score.<CitationRef CitationID="CR147">147</CitationRef>

                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par131">Already at the first commencement exercises over which he presided (1969), Seitz revealed his conservative inclinations. By then, the number of students receiving their PhD degrees had grown to twenty-seven. At the same time, most of the campuses in the United States were experiencing the opposition of students to the war in Vietnam and to the intrusion and deep influence of the military-industrial complex in the research activities of universities. Many of the Rockefeller graduating students were members of a student organization that was actively engaged in opposing the Vietnam War and the funding by Congress of the Safeguard anti-ballistic missile (ABM) and wore buttons on their gown that stated in large letters “Stop ABM.” Evidently many among them had proposed to Seitz that this commencement be devoted what Seitz later characterized as matters “more socially important and relevant than science.”</Para>
                <Para ID="Par132">Breaking with the university’s tradition, Seitz indicated at the commencement that the students’ request was received too late for it to be acted upon by the faculty as a whole and that the “few faculty members he did consult were not enthusiastic.” And he concluded his remarks by indicating that he believed science to be very relevant to human history and that “open discussion…is indeed an obligation or solemn duty in the proper occasion of which this is certainly one.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR148">148</CitationRef>
                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par133">Seitz’s tenure as president of Rockefeller was difficult. He had to confront and address the financial pressures that resulted from US involvement in Vietnam and to rethink, because of the emerging financial constraints, the university’s expansion beyond the natural sciences. When Seitz took office the stock market had fallen sharply, resulting in a sizable reduction of the university’s endowment and additionally, inflation had markedly decreased the value of its returns. Adding to these difficulties was the fact that a seventeen story research “tower” was under construction whose cost had originally been estimated to be around $38 million and was being paid for largely by endowment funds. Inflation was augmenting its costs markedly, and inflation was increasing the expenditures for all university operations. Furthermore, in the early 1970s there was a sharp curtailment of government funding with federal research and training grants becoming much harder to get, putting further demands on the university’s resources. In consequence, the university began running an annual deficit, which in 1974 (the year after the Arab oil embargo) amounted to $2.2 million.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par134">The Board of Trustees’ and Seitz’s response to the new financial realities was to rethink the university’s commitment to have PhD programs in disciplines outside the natural sciences. Thus, in 1974, Albert Gold, the university’s vice president for academic resources, with Seitz‘s approval, held separate, informal, and unofficial conversations with the four philosophy professors, Davidson, Frankfurt, Feinberg, and Kripke. He told them that a “significant number of members of the faculty and of the board of trustees felt that the ‘experiment’ with philosophy at Rockefeller had failed,” but indicated that “Seitz was committed to the principle of tenure and would support the philosophers as long as he held his office.” But he noted that “Seitz was approaching retirement age and in view of the prevailing attitude toward the discipline and future uncertainties, they might think about moving.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR149">149</CitationRef> Starting already in 1972, no graduate students in philosophy were being accepted and no junior faculty member in philosophy was being promoted, nor was a replacement being hired when a junior faculty’s appointment ended.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par135">At first, the philosophers believed that this was happening because of the austerity measures Seitz had imposed, but they came to realize that the administration was sending them an unambiguous message. They thought of taking legal action and to ask the American Association of University Professors to intervene on their behalf, but decided against it and hired a lawyer to enter into negotiations with the university. Since each one of them received an invitation to join the philosophy department at an outstanding university,<CitationRef CitationID="CR150">150</CitationRef> they accepted the administration’s offer to pay them three years of salary and retirement benefits and left. Kripke, who was dragging his feet and was the last of the four to come to terms with the situation, received a letter from Seitz in July 1976 stating that “the philosophy program was being terminated and that after another academic year and with the salary payments accepted by his colleagues his ‘appointment will be deemed to expire.’” At that same time, Seitz wrote to the logicians Hao Wang and Donald Martin that in the future the university would not be a very attractive place for them to work, and “proposed” to Wang, who was a tenured professor, that in the coming months he “investigate alternate posts at other universities.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR151">151</CitationRef> Seitz withdrew his letters to Kripke after he received severe criticisms from the faculty on his handling of the negotiation and the possibility of having dismissed tenured members of the faculty. Seitz had been alerted to the tenure issue by the faculty members on the committee he had set up to advise him on university priorities. They had stressed that if the university were to “concentrate” its degree programs in the biomedical sciences this would have to be done by attrition and not by dismissal. Shortly after receiving the letter from Seitz, Kripke decided to accept the university’s offer and departed. The question of whether tenure had been abrogated thus remained unresolved.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par136">Seitz and the board of trustees had in fact accepted the recommendation of the committee on university priorities that the university promote and cultivate only disciplines that contribute directly to the life sciences, those being the central concern of the institution. Seitz and the board were evidently ready not only to dismiss the philosophers and logicians, but to go further in phasing out the “ancillary disciplines.” However, the furor over the way the severance of the philosophers had been handled forestalled further “concentration” by drastic means.<CitationRef CitationID="CR152">152</CitationRef>
                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par137">What was happening at Rockeller University made the Sunday, September 26, 1976, edition of the <Emphasis Type="Italic">New York Times</Emphasis>. The three column wide headline on the front page stated in large print: “Rockefeller University Hit by Storm over Tenure.” In the opening paragraphs Israel Shenker, the reporter who covered the story,<CitationRef CitationID="CR153">153</CitationRef> indicated that “a summer storm over tenure has produced perhaps the greatest embarrassment in the institution’s 75-year history. The philosophy group—with men of world reputation—is being shut down. Logic professors<CitationRef CitationID="CR154">154</CitationRef>—hardly less distinguished are being encouraged to leave. Other professors are finding that their research support is being threatened. Bearing the brunt of the storm is Dr. Frederick Seitz, who is being attacked for his maladroitness in forcing people out to save money.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR155">155</CitationRef> The severance of the philosophers marked the end of the evolution of the university into the ideal that Bronk had envisioned. It was clear that the university would no longer consider expanding with programs in the social sciences and the humanities. In fact, it was not clear how the groups not in the mainstream of the life sciences would fare in the future.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par138">The Board of Trustees did formally affirm that “the long term policy whereby a tenured faculty member is assured of the security of his academic position and salary, and freedom to pursue his scholarly interests whatever they may be” stood and would not be altered. It also conveyed informal assurances to the mathematicians, physicists, and logicians that their jobs were secure. But given what had happened they were apprehensive about what would happen to their programs in the future.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par139">Roman Jackiw, who spent the 1977–78 academic year at Rockefeller University as a visiting professor, recalls that at that time there was a great deal of concern and worry among the physicists about their program, and also a good deal of talk how they—in contrast to the philosophers—would resist attempts to close the program. One of the principal reasons for Shelter Island II coming into being was to prove to the Rockefeller administration the importance of its physics program and prevent the possibility of a sharp reduction in the size of the physics programs.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par140">In 1978, upon Seitz’s retirement, Joshua Lederberg was named president of Rockefeller University. Patrick Haggerty, the chairman of the university’s board of trustees, in making the announcement described Lederberg as a “pioneer” in his field of research, bacterial genetics, and emphasized his “deep concern for strengthening communications between science and the society it serves.” Lederberg had been awarded the Nobel Prize in 1958, when he was thirty-three years old, for his research indicating that bacteria could exchange genetic information during a phase of their reproduction that could be considered sexual and could also do so with the help of viruses of a process he and Norton Zinder called transduction. Lederberg had obtained his BS from Columbia University in 1941, and after serving in the army had earned his PhD from Yale in 1947. Thereafter he accepted a position in the University of Wisconsin’s department of genetics. In 1957, he helped found and became the chairman of the department of medical genetics in the university’s medical school. In 1959, he accepted the chairmanship of the department of genetics of Stanford University’s School of Medicine. He there further developed his interests and competence in computing, in artificial intelligence and in bioinformatics.<CitationRef CitationID="CR156">156</CitationRef>

                <Heading>The Genesis of the Conference</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par141">In 1982, Nicola Khuri, one of the professors of physics at the university, felt that holding an international conference on the foundations of fundamental physics attended by the leading theorists in the field would indicate to the university’s administration the respect the physics group commanded internationally and the value of its presence on the campus, and would thus help anchor theoretical physics at Rockefeller. The reasons for holding such a conference at Shelter Island were twofold. Khuri’s wife descended from a Quaker family, which had come to Massachusetts in the seventeenth century and had been driven out of the Puritan settlement because of their religious beliefs. They had migrated to the eastern tip of Long Island, which became known as Shelter Island. Khuri’s wife had grown up on the island and the Khuris owned a summer home there. The second, more professional reason was that the conference could memorialize the 1947 Shelter Island Conference, which had been a landmark in the history of theoretical physics.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par142">In the summer of 1982, Khuri approached Rod Nichols,<CitationRef CitationID="CR157">157</CitationRef> the executive vice president of the university, to explore his reaction to have Rockefeller University sponsor such a conference. He also contacted Seitz to enlist his help about possible funding of such a conference. The reaction of both of them being positive, in September, Khuri wrote the letter to Lederberg reproduced in figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig4">4</InternalRef> below.<CitationRef CitationID="CR158">158</CitationRef> A few days later, on October 4, Lederberg sent Khuri a note, stating: “More than pleased, I am happy to endorse your proposal, and proud to have the Rockefeller University take the part you suggest in sponsoring the conference.”<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig4">

                    <Para ID="Par151">The conference will be held in the same room in Ram’s Head Inn that was used in 1947. This limits us to 85 participants.</Para>
                    <Para ID="Par152">The program is still in a state of flux and will be sent to you early in 1983. To date, the list of speakers includes: R. P. Feynman, M. Gell-Mann, R. Jackiw, T. D. Lee, J. Schwinger, S. Weinberg, and E. Witten. We are hopeful that L. Faddeev and A. M. Polyakov will be on the program. In addition Professor Bethe has agreed to organize a panel on Shelter Island I and you will be hearing from him about those plans.</Para>
                    <Para ID="Par153">With a special grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation we are pleased to state that the travel and conference expenses of the Shelter Island I participants who are now retired will be reimbursed.</Para>
                    <Para ID="Par154">Please complete the enclosed questionnaire and return it as soon as possible, preferably before December 31, 1982.</Para>

                <Para ID="Par155">Khuri had asked the members of the organizing committee to send him a separate list of “young people” and of older people they thought should be invited. Jackiw sent him a long list containing both. Witten sent him “a list of ‘young’ people” he “might consider inviting,” and added “I have not listed ‘elders’ like Howard Georgi, Dan Freedman, etc., assuming you wanted a list of people who are just a few years out of graduate school.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR159">159</CitationRef>

                <Para ID="Par156">Khuri subsequently demanded very little of the members of the committee. Except for Jackiw, who played an important role in deciding who should be invited and in helping organize the program of the conference, all the demands and responsibilities for making the conference possible were shouldered by Khuri and his very able administrative secretary, Judy Cuozzo. These included obtaining funds to cover the expenditures of the conference, finding hotels to accommodate and feed all the participants, attending to the special needs of some of the participants—such as paying for the flight of the graduate student who would help Hawking, or making sure that Tom Kibble’s young son could sleep in his parents’ room—and making sure that there were adequate toilet facilities at the conference.</Para>

                        <Para ID="Par161">The adjective “fundamental” that was to characterize the conference can be used with two different meanings. On the one hand, it can be understood as implying the search of new properties of physical systems in a given field and their explanation; and on the other, it can imply the search for basic, possibly “ultimate” laws that explain and govern the properties of all matter and energy. Clearly, Khuri and the organizing committee meant “fundamental” in the latter narrower meaning: no condensed matter theorists attended.<CitationRef CitationID="CR163">163</CitationRef>

                <Heading>The Program</Heading>
                <Para ID="Par163">Since the conference was to commemorate Shelter Island I, part of the opening session was to be devoted to recollections and assessments of Shelter Island I by its participants. In late October 1982, Khuri asked Bethe to organize a two-hour session at the conference to be devoted “to some of the most important topics of Shelter Island I, and discussions where they led to.” On December 8, Bethe wrote to Feynman, Schwinger, Pais, Weisskopf, Lamb, and Kinoshita, the people he wanted to talk at the session. His suggestions for the topics to be addressed, and by whom, were: Bethe and Weisskopf, Kramers’s idea of renormalization; Lamb, the Lamb experiment of 1947 and its further developments; Bethe, the first crude estimate of the Lamb shift; Schwinger and Feynman, the development of covariant QED; Kinoshita, modern experiments and calculations of the magnetic moment of the electron and muon; Marshak, the paradox of the experiment of Piccioni et al., as seen in 1947, and its resolution by the discovery of the pi meson.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par164">In his letter, Bethe noted that he had not asked Pais and Serber to talk, but should they want to do so, they should write to him. Marshak promptly answered him in mid-December 1982 indicating that he was “certainly…in agreement with the program” but suggested the panel to discuss Kramer’s idea of renormalization be composed of Bethe, Pais, and himself, and that Rabi talk about his experiment with Nafe and Nelson on the hyperfine structure of hydrogen and Serber about Oppenheimer.</Para>
                <Para ID="Par165">Feynman only answered in early March 1983, prompted by a further query from Bethe, and asked to be excused from talking, just as had Pais and Serber. He noted that:<BlockQuote>
                    <Para ID="Par166">The program you outlined seemed very good—if you really want to do it all; because every body knows what things led to. I hope Schweiger [sic] will talk and not me, because I would feel very foolish talking on a subject as old and well known as covariant QED. Is there a way you could leave me in the nirvana now containing Pais and Serber? Thanks.<CitationRef CitationID="CR164">164</CitationRef>

                        </Para>
                <Para ID="Par167">On March 9, Pais informed Bethe that his failure to reply to his letter “re reporting at Shelter Island had a reason.” “When I got your letter, I was not at all sure that I would go to that meeting. I am still not sure. So for now: if I come I’ll be glad to help.”</Para>
                <Para ID="Par168">Not having heard from Schwinger, Bethe wrote to him on March 16, 1983, stating that Khuri had informed him that he, Schwinger, would give a talk in the opening session of the Shelter Island II conference, and he therefore assumed that he would not want to give a talk in the reminiscences session. Bethe asked him to confirm that this was indeed the case and hoped that in his talk Schwinger would refer to Shelter Island I and also talk about recent calculations of the Lamb shift.</Para>

                    <Para ID="Par170">Please accept my deepest apologies for not responding to your letters concerning Shelter Island II. From the beginning I have been ambivalent about this meeting. As you may know, I have spent some time in the last few years writing down my remembrances of things past. (To my knowledge, these are still not published.) I cannot imagine changing anything in this documented account, and to be forced into conflict with other people’s attitudes and memories would be painful. Then, as the recently released program makes clear, the supposed historical orientation of the meeting is really only a gimmick, the conference is actually devoted to today’s activities. And, for whatever intellectual or psychological reasons, I do not have much empathy with the current direction; I would not ordinarily go to a meeting of this kind.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par177">It was John Archibald Wheeler (see figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig8">8</InternalRef>), who, at a joint meeting of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in the fall of 1945, noted that the experimental data in “elementary particle physics” that had been obtained during the 1930s made it possible to identify four “fundamental” interactions: the “strong” forces responsible for nuclear interactions, the electromagnetic forces between electrically charged particles, the “weak” forces responsible for beta decay, and the gravitational forces. It was evident that the gravitational forces could be neglected when considering elementary particle processes, given the weakness of the force and the distances being probed by experiments. When the first Rochester Conference was held in 1950, most physicists held the view that electrons, photons, protons, neutrons, π-mesons, µ-mesons, and neutrinos were “elementary particles”; that the four interactions were independent realms and that quantum electrodynamics, pseudoscalar meson theory, and Fermi’s beta decay theory were “fundamental” theories of the electromagnetic, nuclear and weak interactions. But what became clear very quickly was that the elucidation of the dynamics of the subnuclear world would require their simultaneous consideration.<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig8">

Klein, Puppi, and Tiomo and Wheeler arrived independently at the same conclusion. One thereafter spoke of a “universal” Fermi interaction. Given that the weak interactions all seemed to have the same value of the coupling constant, Lee, Rosenbluth, and Yang suggested that in analogy with electromagnetism, where all charges, irrespective of their masses, interact with same coupling constant, that the weak interactions have the same property. In analogy with the electromagnetic forces, which are quantum field theoretically interpreted as mediated by the exchange of spin one photons (massless because electromagnetic forces have infinite range), Lee, Rosenbluth, and Yang suggested that the weak forces should be considered as mediated by an intermediate massive spin one boson (since the weak forces are short ranged). They had hoped that this might solve the problem of the non-renormalizabilty of the Fermi interaction. But spin-one theories with massive quanta were likewise not renormalizable.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par179">The views expressed by Lee, Rosenbluth, and Yang became part of the collective knowledge of the community, and the search for a renormalizable theory that would allow a spin-one particle to mediate the weak forces became one of the threads in the “steady evolution of theoretical ideas, leading almost imperceptibly to changes in previous beliefs.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par180">On the other hand, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">τ</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">θ</Emphasis> puzzle challenged a widely accepted view regarding the symmetry properties of the fundamental interactions. The puzzle consisted in the fact that two particles, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">θ</Emphasis> and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">τ</Emphasis> meson, which, to the extant experimental accuracy, had the same mass and lifetime and therefore seemingly were the same particle, decayed in two different modes, the <Emphasis Type="Italic">θ</Emphasis> into two pions and the <Emphasis Type="Italic">τ</Emphasis> into three, thereby raising the possibility that parity was not conserved because the pion was known to have negative parity. As a result of questions that Martin Block and Feynman posed at the 1956 Rochester Conference to Lee and Yang, who had constructed a model to explain the seeming violation of parity conservation, they made a careful study of all known experiments involving weak interactions. After reviewing them, Lee and Yang concluded that that there was no evidence of parity conservation in any weak interaction.<CitationRef CitationID="CR167">167</CitationRef> In his Nobel lecture, Yang commented that although past experiments on the weak interactions gave no proof of parity conservation, “in strong interactions…there were indeed many experiments that established parity conservation to a high degree of accuracy.” Furthermore, Yang noted: “The fact that parity conservation in the weak interactions was believed for so long without experimental support was very startling. But what was more startling was the prospect that a space-time symmetry law which the physicists have learned so well may be violated.” Wu, Ambler, Hayward, and Hobson with an experiment on the<Emphasis Type="Italic"> β </Emphasis>decay of polarized Co<Superscript>60</Superscript> nuclei, and Garwin, Lederman, and Weinrich, and Friedman and Telegdi with their experiments on the <Emphasis Type="Italic">π</Emphasis>-<Emphasis Type="Italic">µ</Emphasis> decay proved that parity was indeed violated in the weak interactions.<CitationRef CitationID="CR168">168</CitationRef>

The condensation of Cooper pairs creates a gap in the spectrum by making the photon massive and makes electrical currents superconducting. Its effect on magnetic fields is known as the Meissner effect. Magnetic fields cannot penetrate the superconductor except in thin flux tubes. Thus, when two magnetic monopoles are inserted in a superconductor, a thin flux tube gets created between them. The energy stored in the flux tube depends linearly on the length of the flux tube and therefore the potential between two magnetic monopoles is linear. Such a linear potential is known as a confining potential.<CitationRef CitationID="CR176">176</CitationRef> In 1959, in an influential paper, Nambu suggested that the masses of elementary particles might arise in a similar way as in BCS: the vacuum state might not respect the symmetries of the theory—the phenomenon known as a spontaneously broken symmetry—and like the quasiparticles of the BCS theory, elementary particles might acquire mass. In 1961, Nambu and Jona-Lasinio went on to construct a model<CitationRef CitationID="CR177">177</CitationRef> of a massless fermion field ψ(<Emphasis Type="Italic">x</Emphasis>) that exhibited these characteristics.<CitationRef CitationID="CR178">178</CitationRef> They then showed that this would imply a non-zero mass for the “quasiparticle” of that theory, which they identified with the nucleon. However, their model also predicted the existence of a pseudoscalar, mass zero, spin zero particle—the “Goldstone” boson of that model.<CitationRef CitationID="CR179">179</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par203">At the end of the 1920s, Edwin Hubble had established that the universe was expanding, with each galaxy receding from every other galaxy with a velocity proportional to the distance between them. Hubble’s law is usually written with our galaxy as singled out. It then states that <Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis> = <Emphasis Type="Italic">Hl</Emphasis>, where <Emphasis Type="Italic">v</Emphasis> is the recession velocity of the observed galaxy <Emphasis Type="Italic">l</Emphasis> its distance from us, and <Emphasis Type="Italic">H</Emphasis> is Hubble’s constant, a “constant” that varies as the universe evolves. This picture of a homogeneous expansion of the universe when extrapolated backward in time implies that at some instant in the past all the galaxies coalesced and the density of the universe and its temperature were infinite. Although there had been earlier speculations, by Friedmann and Lemaitre, about the evolution of the universe from a big bang, it was George Gamow and his students, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, who, in the late 1940s, made use of the extant knowledge of nuclear physics, to make the study of the early universe an integral part of cosmology. Gamow pointed out that the very early, very hot universe would have been permeated by black body radiation and that as the universe evolved from its hot initial state and expanded, this black body radiation would have cooled, and the universe at present would be bathed by the cooled black body radiation whose temperature he estimated to be around 7 K. Gamow, Alpher, and Herman’s prediction was confirmed in 1964 when Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson discovered an isotropic uniform background of microwave radiation with an effective temperature of about 3 K.<CitationRef CitationID="CR202">202</CitationRef> It quickly became accepted that the uniform microwave background radiation (MBR) that Penzias and Wilson had discovered was the primordial fireball.<CitationRef CitationID="CR203">203</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par204">The second set of phenomena Gamow investigated to support the big bang theory was concerned with nucleosynthesis in the very early universe before galaxies and stars had formed. Based on the assumption that neutrons were the primordial elements, such calculations were first undertaken by Alpher, Gamow, and Herman in the late 1940s.<CitationRef CitationID="CR204">204</CitationRef> The modern theory of cosmological nucleosynthesis was formulated in 1966 by P. J. E. Peebles, who at the time was a student in Dicke’s group studying cosmology. Dicke, in the early 1960s, had started a program of experimental gravitational research at Princeton and in 1966 had set up an experiment to detect the cosmic background radiation that would be the remnant of conditions of the early universe in the oscillating model of cosmology he believed in, in which the universe expanded and contracted.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par205">Peebles assumed the validity of the big bang theory. Given the ambient temperature during the first few minutes after the big bang, there were virtually no nuclei present since nuclei would be not be able to remain bound in that environment. The universe then consisted of a hot gas of photons and neutrinos, with a very much smaller density of protons, neutrons, and electrons. As the universe cooled, the protons and neutrons combined to form nuclei. Extending earlier calculations by Alpher, Follin, and Herman, Peebles calculated the expected abundances of the light chemical elements—deuterons, He<Superscript>3</Superscript>, He<Superscript>4</Superscript>, and Li<Superscript>7</Superscript>. He found that most of the matter in the universe would remain in the form of hydrogen, with about 25% by mass being converted into He<Superscript>4</Superscript> which was 10<Superscript>8</Superscript> times more abundant than lithium 7. These numbers depended on the present abundance of protons and neutrons in the universe (though that was not known with great accuracy) but were in general agreement with the observed cosmic abundance of these elements.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par206">Going back in time in the history of the universe correlates temporal changes with temperature changes. One uses the temperature changes to conjecture a historical process for the evolution of the universe in a big bang scenario. Thus, if one goes back sufficiently in time one arrives at an era when the temperature and density were so high so that radiation and matter were in thermal equilibrium. But as the universe expanded and the temperature dropped the radiation went out of equilibrium with matter. However, a detailed analysis indicates that the black body spectrum when matter and radiation were in equilibrium was preserved as the photons went out of equilibrium with matter. The story of the evolution of the universe from the time it was a very hot plasma of electrons, positrons, and neutrinos, and a very small density of neutrons, protons, deuterons, and helium atoms can be told with some confidence.<CitationRef CitationID="CR205">205</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par207">After QCD was formulated, the question arose whether the standard model could be incorporated in that framework, with quarks, gluons, and leptons being the “elementary” constituents of the primordial soup. Also of great importance were the details of how the symmetry breaking mechanism would explain why the electroweak interactions are different from the strong interactions at energies below the GUT energy. Kirzhnits and Linde in 1972 had qualitatively investigated whether a <Emphasis Type="Italic">global</Emphasis> broken symmetry would be restored if the temperature were sufficiently high.<CitationRef CitationID="CR206">206</CitationRef> In 1974, Weinberg took up the problem and investigated the case of <Emphasis Type="Italic">local</Emphasis> broken symmetries in relativistic quantum field theories—in particular in gauge theories—and showed how to calculate the critical temperature at which a phase transition occurs for general renormalizable fields using a Feynman diagrammatic approach. At Weinberg’s suggestion, Jackiw also took up the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking at finite temperature and showed how to calculate the critical temperature more generally using functional methods.<CitationRef CitationID="CR207">207</CitationRef> In Weinberg, and in Dolan and Jackiw, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is accomplished by a Higgs-like scalar field that acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The phase transition occurs because thermal fluctuations at high temperatures destroy the non-zero expectation value of the Higgs field.</Para>

Coleman called it a “false vacuum.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR208">208</CitationRef> The qualitative features of the decay process closely parallel the nucleation processes of statistical mechanics, the crystallization of supersaturated solution, or the boiling of a superheated fluid, which had previously been investigated by Langer.<CitationRef CitationID="CR209">209</CitationRef> Thus one can think of the false vacuum as corresponding to the superheated fluid phase and the true vacuum to the vapor phase. In that situation, thermodynamic fluctuations continuously cause bubbles of the vapor phase to materialize in the fluid phase. What happens to a bubble depends on its size and the gain (or loss) in volume energy as compared to the gain (or loss) in surface energy. Coleman invoked an identical picture to describe the decay of the false vacuum. “Once in a while, a bubble of false vacuum will form so that it is classically energetically favorable for the bubble to grow. Once this happens, the bubble spreads throughout the universe converting false vacuum to true.” The issue becomes computing the probability of decay of the false vacuum per unit time per unit volume, with Coleman stressing that “such a computation would be bootless [i.e. pointless] were it not for cosmology.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR210">210</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par209">The history of the universe before the period of radiation domination is much more conjectural than for the period after. It is generally assumed that the average energies of the “particles” present increases as one goes back in time in the every early universe. When the energies were greater than the Planck energy, 10<Superscript>19</Superscript> GeV, quantum effects were important and the classical description by general relativity of space and time is inadequate. A plausible description would require an (unavailable at present) quantum theory of gravity. As the universe cooled, once the particle energies were lower than 10<Superscript>19</Superscript> GeV one can ignore quantum fluctuations of the space-time metric and treat the quantum fields present as evolving in a classical space-time background. Given that then the universe was homogeneous and isotropic, having negligible curvature, its space-time can be described general relativistically by a Robertson-Walker metric<Equation ID="Eque">

Thus, for example, in December 1979 Alexei Starobinsky published a theory of inflation in a well-known Soviet journal that was translated into English.<CitationRef CitationID="CR211">211</CitationRef> He indicated that a characteristic spectrum of primordial gravitational waves would be produced from any inflationary universe, regardless of the model. But his contribution did not receive the attention it merited, perhaps because it did not deal with particle physics. Inflation attracted little attention until Alan Guth “incited interest…by noting what it was good for.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR212">212</CitationRef>
                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par211">In the late 1970s, Guth was working with Henry Tye on seeing what happens to <Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(5) magnetic monopoles in the early universe. They made use of Coleman’s model for the potential of the Higgs-like scalar fields that spontaneously broke the <Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(5) symmetry to <Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(3)×<Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(2)×<Emphasis Type="Italic">U</Emphasis>(1). They also made use of Coleman’s calculations for the decay rate of the false vacuum, i.e. when Higgs-like scalar fields get caught in a local minimum of the potential, which is a state with unbroken <Emphasis Type="Italic">SU</Emphasis>(5) symmetry. This false vacuum has a huge negative pressure. Guth realized that this peculiar feature of the false vacuum would have a dramatic effect on the evolution of the universe. It would produce a constant rate of expansion, i.e. an <Emphasis Type="Italic">R</Emphasis>(<Emphasis Type="Italic">t</Emphasis>) that grows exponentially. Barrier penetration eventually stops the inflation, with the scalar fields rolling down the potential toward the global minimum, the broken symmetry state, which corresponds to the present universe. The vacuum energy of this broken symmetry state must be small otherwise it would be the source of a large cosmological constant, implying that the vacuum energy of the false vacuum must have been high.</Para>

              <Para ID="Par216">Guth’s original formulation of inflation assumed that it would end with the formation of bubbles of broken symmetry surrounded by the metastable unbroken symmetry vacuum state. But these bubbles would have expanded and collided and would have left the universe in a much more inhomogeneous state than observed. This difficulty was removed by Albrecht and Steinhardt, by Linde, and by Hawking and Moss, who indicated that the symmetry could be broken slowly in a homogeneous manner. Moreover, they predicted that the present density of the universe would be very close to the critical density. They also made predictions regarding the deviations from exact homogeneity and isotropy that should be observable in the cosmic background radiation. Nevertheless, their model likewise succumbed to criticisms: the resulting inhomogeneities were found to be much too great to lead to galaxies and instead led to superdense objects or black holes.<CitationRef CitationID="CR213">213</CitationRef> Guth, Linde, and Hawking made extensive presentations at Shelter Island II regarding the very early universe. Guth reviewed the basic assumptions and limitations of the basic inflationary model; Linde presented a new inflationary scenario involving supergravity and chaotic initial conditions in the very early universe; and Hawking his speculations why the cosmological constant is probably zero.<CitationRef CitationID="CR214">214</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par217">It is one of the startling facts about the Shelter Island II conference that inflation—a theory that makes conjectures about what happened from 10<Superscript>−36</Superscript> to 10<Superscript>−33</Superscript> seconds after the big bang—should receive that much attention. That inflation is a falsifiable theory—in particular, its predictions of some of the properties of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background—is surely a factor for its respectful reception. In 2008, Weinberg would write: “So far the details of inflation are unknown, and the whole idea of inflation remains a speculation, though one that is increasingly plausible.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR215">215</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par226">The basic assumption in all the attempts to answer the above questions was that the average energies of particles increases as one goes back in time in the first few seconds after the big bang. When these energies were greater than the Planck energy, 10<Superscript>19</Superscript> GeV, some—presently unknown—quantum gravity theory is an essential component of the appropriate description of the dynamics of that era of the evolution of the universe. At energies lower than 10<Superscript>19</Superscript> GeV, presumably quantum gravitational effect were negligible and the dynamics of the quantum fields present evolved in a space-time adequately described by general relativity. Quantum fields in curved space-time are supposed to be an adequate approximation to quantum gravity. They actually exhibit new features that have important physical consequences, the most important being black hole evaporation and quantum fluctuations in the early universe. An important feature of quantum fields in curved space is that the vacuum state can evolve into an excited state. Not only can particles be produced by a time-dependent space-time background, but particle production can also occur in a locally static space-time like that of a Schwartzschild black hole.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par227">Furthermore, in the energy region between 10<Superscript>19</Superscript> GeV and 10<Superscript>15</Superscript> GeV, some GUT is assumed to be the appropriate description of the dynamics of the quantum fields, possibly a GUT that incorporates supersymmetry, a symmetry that relates particles of integral spin with particles of half-integral spin. Supersymmetric theories have certain attractive technical features because cancellation between bosonic and fermionic closed loop reduces drastically the divergences encountered in perturbative calculations. Supergravity was at the center of discussions at the Nuffield workshop.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par228">But before turning to some remarks about supersymmetry, let me make an observation about the participants of the 1982 Nuffield workshop.

The problem of how to unify the electroweak and the strong forces, and how to incorporate gravity into such a unified theory was considered one of the most fundamental, unsolved, problems.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par242">Yet it was recognized that the usual approach to “quantizing” field systems, whether by Feynman’s path integral or by more conventional approaches, could not overcome the difficulties encountered when attempting to formulate a quantum theory of gravity. By the early 1980s, it had became apparent, through the work of John Schwarz and others, that string theory offered a framework for overcoming the difficulties encountered in quantizing gravity.<CitationRef CitationID="CR227">227</CitationRef> The theory arose in the late 1960s as an alternative to quantum field theory in which the fundamental entities are considered oscillations of one-dimensional strings rather than zero dimensional points, a particle being just a string in a particular state of vibration. In string theory, interactions are spread out over the strings rather than concentrated at a single point, thereby preventing infinities. The existence of a spin-two graviton in the theory came to be seen as a necessary feature of string theory, and string theorists came to characterize gravity as an essential component of and a “prediction” of string theory. Supersymmetry likewise became considered to be another general prediction of string theory.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par243">Witten has made the point that if the real and complex numbers are regarded as real vector spaces, then the dimension of the real vector space is one, that of the complex vector space is two. The orbit of a point particle in space-time is a real one-dimensional manifold, while that of a string in space-time is two-dimensional and should be regarded as a complex Riemann surface. Hence, for Witten, “physics without strings is roughly analogous to mathematics without complex numbers.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR228">228</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par244">One can think of the motion of a string through space as sweeping out a two-dimensional surface so that string theory is the theory of these two-dimensional surfaces. The dynamical problems of strings using the Feynman integral-over-paths involves summing over all possible two-dimensional surfaces. Mathematicians had classified all possible two-dimensional surfaces according to their topology. Hence, physicists made use of these results. Conversely, supersymmetry provided a powerful new mathematical tool in the exploration of topological properties.</Para>

Kinoshita, Veltman, Strubbe, Hearn, Lautrup, and others wrote extensive programs to do the algebraic operations in reducing Feynman diagrams and to efficiently carry out the multidimensional integrations using Monte Carlo methods.

              <Para ID="Par254">Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh, in their perceptive book on <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Mathematical Experience</Emphasis>, defined mathematics as “the study of mental objects with reproducible properties.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR233">233</CitationRef> Their pointing to reproducibility and to the mental aspect of the enterprise captures something essential about mathematics. Indeed, a great deal of mathematics had its origin in physics, in the study of permanent objects and the reproducibility/periodicity of their motions. David Mumford has gone further than Davis and Hirsh. In an essay on “The Dawning of The Age of Stochasticity,” he argued that all of mathematics arose and arises “by abstracting some aspect of our experiences, and that alongside the mathematics which arises from objects and their motions in the material world, formal logic arose, in the work of Aristotle, from observing thought itself.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR234">234</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par255">That mathematicians at times construct mathematical entities and structures seemingly developed to satisfy strictly internal needs of the discipline, which later on find useful and important applications in physics is well known. Riemannian geometry, its Levi-Civita tensor calculus formulation, and its appropriation by Einstein as the framework and the mathematical language of general relativity is an oft-cited example of this phenomenon. Yet Riemannian geometry traces its root to Gauss’s efforts to abstract some of his efforts concerning geodesy.<CitationRef CitationID="CR235">235</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par256">In an essay in the volume issued in 2000 by the International Mathematical Union addressing <Emphasis Type="Italic">Frontiers and Perspectives</Emphasis> of mathematics in the new century, Witten tried to foresee some of the possible influence of physics on mathematics by describing past trends. He pointed to general relativity giving a big boost to the growth of Riemannian geometry during the twentieth century. Differentiating between the quantum theory of particles and the “deeper part of quantum theory, the quantum theory of fields,” Witten attributed much of the development of functional analysis, spectral theory and related areas during the twentieth century to the former, but believed that “in some sense most of the [quantum theory of fields]’s influence on mathematics belongs to the twenty-first century.” He considered the standard model with its non-abelian gauge theories and asymptotic freedom as having set the stage “for a new kind of interaction between quantum field theory and geometry.” Subsequently, supersymmetry and string theory led physicists to gradually ask new kind of questions that involved geometrical concepts and techniques not previously used in physics. In time it was realized that things could be turned around, and that quantum field theory methods could be used to draw inferences about geometry. And so it is that, although quantum field theory is a rather old subject, its mathematical influence is in many respects rather recent, and still lies mainly in the future.<CitationRef CitationID="CR236">236</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par257">To amplify Witten’s remarks: in the 1960s and 1970s, mathematicians and physicists witnessed a confluence of concepts and ideas. On one side were the abelian and non-abelian gauge theories describing the electroweak and strong interactions; on the other was an internally motivated extension of Riemannian geometry involving mathematical structures known as fiber bundles. When studying the topology and differential geometry of surfaces in an arbitrary number of dimensions, mathematicians found it useful to introduce auxiliary spaces, such as the space consisting of the tangent planes to the surface being studied or the space of lines normal to that surface. Such spaces are called fiber bundles, the fibers being the auxiliary spaces and the bundle the totality of fibers that are fitted together. The classification of bundles and their invariants was studied in the 1930s and 1940s by Hassler Whitney, Norman Steenrod, Lev Pontrjagin, Shiing-Shen Chern, and others. They obtained integral formulas for the invariants of bundles that generalize the Gauss-Bonnet formula. The latter states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature over an entire surface is a topological invariant—that is, the value of the integral is not changed by local deformation of the surface—and is a multiple of 2<Emphasis Type="Italic">π</Emphasis>.</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par268">I noticed its similarity to the equation of gauge theory. After the lecture I examined these two equations in detail and realized they were in fact both special cases of a general type of equation. In great excitement I went to Jim Simons, who was then the Chair of Mathematics Department in Stony Brook. He told me they were both equations in <Emphasis Type="Italic">fiber bundle</Emphasis> theory and gave me a copy of a standard monograph on the subject by Steenrod. The book turned out to be too dry and too formal for me and I did not learn anything from it. A few years later I asked Simons to give us physicists informal lectures on the basic ideas of fiber bundle theory. These lectures were extremely helpful to us, enabling us to realize that the basic <Emphasis Type="Italic">physical</Emphasis> concepts of all gauge theory (including electromagnetism), such as <Emphasis Type="Italic">potentials</Emphasis>, <Emphasis Type="Italic">field strengths</Emphasis>, etc., are in fact identical to beautiful basic <Emphasis Type="Italic">geometrical</Emphasis> concepts in fiber bundle theory. <Emphasis Type="Italic">I was deeply awed and inspired by this realization.</Emphasis>

              <Para ID="Par270">In concluding this section, I want to reemphasize the <Emphasis Type="Italic">novel</Emphasis> symbiotic nature of the connection that evolved between physics and mathematics, a bond that was already manifest at Shelter Island II. What is new about this interaction, and why I have labeled it “novel” is that it is concerned with ideas at the forefront of theoretical physics and of mathematics and that it involves the leading geometers and the leading field theorists and string theorists. Manin, in his essay on “Mathematics as Profession and Vocation,” has given the most succinct characterization of this new symbiosis. He noted that: “Mathematics has no fixed rules of semantic interpretation in the physical world: the same wave equation can describe ocean waves, sound, light, and ‘waves of probability’ in quantum mechanics. In this sense, mathematics is a great source of metaphors. The act of interpretation of a mathematical construction in, say theoretical physics, must be separated from the construction itself.” Manin went on to observe:<BlockQuote>
                  <Para ID="Par271">a less traditional relationship has crystallized [between mathematics and physics] since the 70s. Simultaneously with the success of the “standard model” which satisfactorily described the observable spectrum of elementary particles and interactions, physicists started developing rather romantic models that might be relevant at the very high energy of the Big Bang. The study of these models required and stimulated the development of sophisticated and sometimes amazingly new mathematics, mostly connected with the quantum theory of fields and strings. This process is in full swing now.</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par272">In my opinion, one can now speak about the emerging program of “quantization of classical mathematics” which has a wider scope than just cooperation with the physicists in a common endeavor to understand the theory of quantum strings.<CitationRef CitationID="CR258">258</CitationRef>

              <Para ID="Par273">In the facetious opening paragraph of his essay “Polymathematics: Is Mathematics a Single or Science or a Set of Arts,” the great Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnol’d commented:<BlockQuote>
                  <Para ID="Par274">All mathematics is divided in three parts: cryptography (paid for by CIA, KBG, and the like), hydrodynamics (supported by manufacturers of atomic submarines) and celestial mechanics (financed by military and other institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA).</Para>

                  <Para ID="Par277">Celestial mechanics is the origin of dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, variational calculus and symplectic geometry.</Para>
                  <Para ID="Par278">The existence of mysterious relations between all these different domains is the most striking and delightful feature of mathematics (having no rational explanation).<CitationRef CitationID="CR260">260</CitationRef>
                           </Para>

                     </Para>
              <Para ID="Par279">The strong coupling between pure mathematics and the more nefarious aspects of state power are even more pronounced in the case of physics. One can argue that Shelter Island I assembled a group of leading young American physicists who had been endowed with self-confidence by the war time work they had done, work that had produced the means to give the United States a victorious conclusion to World War II. These young physicists—in part to purify themselves—went on to produce a usable quantum electrodynamics and laid the foundations for making possible the formulation of the standard model later on.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par280">Shelter Island II brought together leading young physicists who had been endowed with self-confidence by the work they, and other members of their generation, had done to create outstanding pure physics: “the standard model.” That is why inflation could be taken so seriously at the conference and why, despite the fact that no detailed experimental predictions could be made from string theory, these young physicists nonetheless would invest huge efforts into advancing the theory during the next two decades until the LHC went into operation.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par281">But this separation between pure and whatever one wants to call it—applied, engineering—physics is tenuous. In fact, because Shelter Island II was in part convened to celebrate the physicists who had made Shelter Island I so memorable made the connection between physics and power explicit at the most important social function of the conference: its banquet.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par282">David E. DeCosse, a reporter for the <Emphasis Type="Italic">East Hampton Star</Emphasis> attended the banquet that was held on June 2. He opened his long description of “A Conclave of Physics” in the June 8 issue of the paper with the statement: “At a time when the world is forcefully reacting to the threat of nuclear power,<CitationRef CitationID="CR261">261</CitationRef> and in a week of civil protest at the Shoreham nuclear plant, some of the scientists who had harnessed the power of the atom and some who are now approaching an understanding of the creation of the universe gathered last week in placid surroundings on Shelter Island for a conference called Shelter Island II: Quantum Field Theory and the Fundamental Problems of Physics.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par283">DeCosse reported that at the banquet Professor Steven Weinberg had toasted his Shelter Island I predecessors for having “both reasserted science and playing a heroic and terribly important part in winning the War.” And he noted that at other times during the evening the “earlier period was remembered as a courageous and productive time.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par284">After the banquet, DeCosse interviewed both Stephen Hawking and Victor Weisskopf. A somewhat optimistic Hawking told him that the conference was concerned with what had been called the grand unification theory “that describes the behavior of all the forces of nature” as well as “the yet not fully-understood ‘big bang’, the beginning of the universe, [and that it] had a ‘50-50’ chance of being uncovered by the end of the century.” Hawking thought that this grand unified theory, when found, “it will influence the way people think about themselves and the world they live in. It will be the same way that Einstein’s theory of relativity influenced the way people thought even though they did not understand it.”</Para>
              <Para ID="Par285">But it was nuclear weapons, and the making of nuclear weapons by physicists, that dominated the interview. DeCosse quoted Weisskopf, a veteran of both Los Alamos and of Shelter Island I, as saying: “We had to do it [building the bomb]. This country was in a war, and one has to serve one’s country.” He gave as the motivation for the concentrated effort to build the bomb the fear of the Nazis beating the Americans in producing the bomb because they had discovered fission and presumably had started working on a bomb soon thereafter.</Para>
              <Para ID="Par286">Commenting on DeCosse’s observation that whereas Shelter Island I had looked back two years to the use of two atomic bombs, Shelter Island II looked back to thirty-six years of proliferation of weapons of far greater destructive power, Hawking remarked that “the difference that we have with the Russians are unimportant compared with the possibility of total annihilation.” Weisskopf was pessimistic: “mankind is doomed” unless “the growing revulsion with the nuclear buildup, exemplified by the freeze movement and the recent Catholic Bishops’ pastoral letter on nuclear arms, spreads throughout the population.”<CitationRef CitationID="CR262">262</CitationRef>

              <SimplePara>It would not have been possible to write this article without Nicola Khuri making available all the materials in his possession regarding Shelter Island II. I cannot adequately thank him. I am deeply indebted to Roman Jackiw for sharing with me his recollections of Shelter Island II. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the consideration and thoughtfulness with which Larry Abbott, Steven Adler, Scott Axelrod, Jeremy Butterfield, Leo Corry, Freeman Dyson, Jeffrey Goldstone, Kurt Gottfried, David Gross, Alan Guth, Matthew Headrick, Arthur Jaffe, Albion Lawrence, Peter Lepage, Roman Jackiw, Howard Schnitzer, Isadore Singer, Shlomo Sternberg, Steven Weinberg, Frank Wilczek, and Edward Witten answered my queries in writing or in interviews. My weekly luncheon meetings with George Smith were stimulating and very effective and valuable in clarifying issues. I am indebted to Chris Bostock for reading the manuscript and for his corrections and very helpful suggestions. I had the benefit of Skuli Sigurdsson carefully reading the manuscript and giving me the benefit of his wide erudition. It is a better paper by virtue of his constructive criticisms and his suggestions. And the same is true of the paper by virtue of Joseph Martin’s and Peter Pesic’s editing. I thank them. I am grateful to Evan Fay Earle, at the Kroch Library at Cornell University, and to Loma Karklinks, at the Cal Tech Archives, for their help in making the Bethe notes and the Feynman notes of the Shelter Island Conferences publically available on the web. As always, the support and encouragement of Snait Gissis were invaluable and the discussions with her regarding contexts and historiography deeply appreciated.</SimplePara>

                <BibUnstructured>My use of “collective” resonates with the definition given by Fleck of a “thought collective” as “a community of persons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intellectual interactions, [in which] we will find by implication that it also provides the special ‘carrier’ for the historical development of any field of thought, as well as for the given stock of knowledge and level of culture.

                <BibUnstructured>Furthermore, there was no sharp difference between mathematical physicists and theoretical physicists.

Furthermore, Skuli Sigurdsson pointed out to me that in the early 1930s Hilbert was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in physics (by mathematicians!). See Elisabeth T. Crawford, John L. Heilbron, and Rebecca Ullrich, <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Nobel Population 1901–1937: A Census of the Nominators and Nominees for the Prizes in Physics and Chemistry</Emphasis> (Berkeley, CA: Office for History of Science and Technology, University of California, 1987). Concerning the difference between theoretical physicists and mathematical physicists, John von Neumann made the following incisive observations. Answering questions posed to him by R. O. Fornaguera regarding the nature of mathematical physics and theoretical physics, von Neumann stated that: “I have always drawn a somewhat vague line of demarcation between the two subjects, but it was really more a difference in distribution of emphasis. I think that in theoretical physics the main emphasis is on the connection with experimental physics and those methodological processes which lead to new theories and new formulations, whereas mathematical physics deals with the actual solution and mathematical execution of a theory which assumed to be correct per se, or assumed to be correct for the sake of the discussion. In other words, I would say that theoretical physics deals rather with the formation and mathematical physics rather with the exploitation of physical theories. However, when a new theory has to be evaluated and compared with experience, both aspects mix.” John von Neumann, letter to R. O. Fornaguera, December 10, 1947, in <Emphasis Type="Italic">John von Neumann: Selected Letters</Emphasis>, ed. Miklós Rédei (Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society, 2005), 118–19.</BibUnstructured>

                <BibUnstructured>The concept of a community of practice is due to Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger who in their book <Emphasis Type="Italic">Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation</Emphasis> (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1991) offered a new viewpoint of “learning.” Classical learning theory conceived of learning as an <Emphasis Type="Italic">individual</Emphasis> process whereby a formal body of knowledge is acquired from a teacher or from an expert. Learning was a psychological process whose foci were the brains of individuals. For Lave and Wenger <Emphasis Type="Italic">social</Emphasis> participation is the essential mechanism for learning. Moreover, for them knowledge is not a stable commodity that can be transmitted. After the publication of Wenger’s books many sociologists, historians, and philosophers of science have adopted the view of considering the sciences as communities of practice committed to research enterprises that are expansive and prospective, and have placed particular emphasis on the community’s pervasive social entanglement.

                <BibUnstructured>Thus, that research in general relativity was only marginally pursued from the mid-1920s until the mid-1960s is a reflection of the fact that no new data beyond that connected with Einstein’s three tests—the deflection of light in its passage near the sun, and the gravitational red shift of light—was introduced until Pound and Rebka’s experiment, and the all important experiments by Irwin Shapiro making use of the new radar technology. Similarly, Dicke’s novel experimental approach in the mid-1960s is a crucial factor in making research in general relativity acceptable to the physics community at large.</BibUnstructured>

                <BibUnstructured>Frank Wilczek in an interview on October 9, 2015, stressed this point. While an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago from 1966 to 1970, he did not participate in any of the student demonstrations against the Vietnam War but keenly observed, and was deeply affected, by the upheavals occurring around him. That the student protests likewise deeply affected him was stated by Alan Guth in an interview on August 25, 2015.</BibUnstructured>

                <BibUnstructured>Dresden’s conclusion is reinforced by an analysis of Bethe’s contribution to the eighth Solvay Congress, which was held from September 27 to October 2, 1948. The proceedings of that meeting were never published, but Bethe’s article, entitled “Electromagnetic Shift of Energy Levels,” is available from the Institut Solvay. In section II of that article Bethe analyzed the non-relativistic limit of Schwinger’s Lorentz covariant and gauge invariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics which he had presented at the Pocono conference and at the Michigan summer school earlier that year. In fact, a preprint of Schwinger forthcoming 1948 article on QED was available at the Michigan Summer School. In Bethe’s exposition, the one reference to Kramers consists of the statement “Using the same approximation [of making the dipole approximation and neglecting the recoil of the electron], but in classical electrodynamics, Kramers had developed a theory similar to Schwinger’s in the spring of 1947.” Bethe gave as a reference to Kramers’s work, Kramers’s presentation at the Shelter Island Conference. But in fact Kramers’s work, and that of his students, had been done in the early 1940s. Furthermore, Schwinger’s approach had been based on what he had learned from Kramers’s presentation at Shelter Island.</BibUnstructured>

                <BibUnstructured>Khuri was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and obtained his BA from the American University of Beirut in 1952. He received his PhD from Princeton University 1957 under the supervision of Sam Trieman and Res Jost. His dissertation, a rigorous study of scattering amplitudes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics established the validity of dispersion relations in that context. At the suggestion of Robert Oppenheimer he returned to Lebanon and from 1957 to 1964 he taught at the American University of Beirut, but found himself isolated there. A visiting appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1959 until 1963 allowed him to return to the United States. In 1964, he accepted a position at Rockefeller University. Khuri’s research was in mathematical physics, closely coupled to high energy experimental physics. He made important contributions to the elucidation of Feynman’s path integral.

                <BibUnstructured>A function describing a property of hadrons that can be measured in high-energy scattering experiments is said to <Emphasis Type="Italic">scale</Emphasis> when its value is not determined by the energy at which the measurement is being carried out, but is determined by dimensionless kinematic quantities such as the ratio of the energy to a momentum transfer. Increasing the energy of the probing particle implies decreasing its wavelength, and thus being able to resolve more precisely the spatial features of what is being probed. Thus the property of “scaling” for a cross-section implies that the resolution scale of the scatterer <Emphasis Type="Italic">does not depend on length</Emphasis>, and hence that effectively what ever is responsible for the scattering has a point-like substructure. Scaling behavior for the structure functions of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on nucleons was first proposed by James Bjorken in 1968.</BibUnstructured>

These reflected Cardinal Newman’s idea of a university, which Bronk had spoken of repeatedly: “a University is a place of concourse, whither students come from every quarter for every kind of knowledge.…It is the place for seeing galleries of first-rate pictures, and for hearing wonderful voices and performers of transcendent skill. It is the place for great preachers, great orators, great nobles, great statesmen. In the nature of things, greatness and unity go together; excellence implies a centre….It is the place to which a thousand schools make contributions; in which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to find its equal in some antagonist activity, and its judge in the tribunal of truth. It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries verified and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error exposed, by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with knowledge. It is the place where the professor becomes eloquent, and is a missionary and a preacher, displaying his science in its most complete and most winning form, pouring it forth with the zeal of enthusiasm, and lighting up his own love of it in the breasts of his hearers.…It is a place which wins the admiration of the young by its celebrity, kindles the affections of the middle-aged by its beauty, and rivets the fidelity of the old by its associations.” John Henry Newman, “What is a University, Lecture Dublin 1852,” in <Emphasis Type="Italic">A Newman Treasury,</Emphasis> ed.

                <BibUnstructured>One of the reasons for Chew holding this view was that none of the hadrons seemed more fundamental than any of the others. He therefore rejected the idea of formulating field theories that singled out some subset of the hadrons. Echoing Heisenberg in 1925, he hoped that by focusing on physical observables, in particular the <Emphasis Type="Italic">S</Emphasis>-matrix, he would be able to formulate a theory that would determine the hadron spectrum and the hadronic scattering amplitudes.</BibUnstructured>

                <BibUnstructured>The notes Feynman took of some of the lectures at Shelter Island II have been posted at feynmanlectures.info with the gracious permission of the estate of Richard P. Feynman and the California Institute of Technology. The originals can be found in Box 76, Folder 2, <Emphasis Type="Italic">Singer-Index Theorem</Emphasis>, in <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Feynman Papers</Emphasis> at the Caltech Archives. I thank Michael A. Gottlieb for making this possible. I have not attempted to figure out who is the person whose portrait Feynman sketched on the first page of the notes (possibly Bethe?). Feynman’s extended notes in that folder are fascinating as they reveal his meanderings while listening to some of the lectures. It is also interesting to note that among Feynman’s papers in the Archives of Caltech there is a Folder 76.1, whose content are some 100+ pages of calculations trying to prove quark confinement in a 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills field theory, which seem to extend some of his earlier work (See R. P. Feynman, “The Qualitative Behavior of Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 Dimensions,” <Emphasis Type="Italic">Nuclear Physics</Emphasis>

                           <Emphasis Type="Bold">188</Emphasis> (1981), 479–512). They contain some of the materials he presented in his lecture on QCD at Shelter Island II. The notes Feynman prepared for the presentation he made at Shelter Island II are to be found in Box 51, Folder 18, “How QCD works,” in the Feynman papers.</BibUnstructured>

It is a wide ranging, very stimulating account of developments in mathematics during the second half of the twentieth century, which merits wide dissemination.</BibUnstructured>
